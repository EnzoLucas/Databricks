"2","Abigail","Human","Female",NA,NA,"Abigail was a witch who lived in her house in the outskirts of Vizima. She was not well-liked by the villagers and got blamed for many bad or strange occurrences. Her main skill was alchemy, so though the villagers approached her with suspicion, they also relied on her for potions and poisons - which she provided, rarely bothering with questions or moral objections.In the course of Chapter I, Abigail took in the orphaned Alvin after Geralt saved him from the barghests as Shani could not care for him from an inn. She also facilitated a trance where the boy revealed more about the beast and its minions who were plaguing the village.Geralt can buy a blade coating formula from her that makes it easier to battle specters and ghosts. In fact, she buys and sells quite a few things:If her fate was left to the villagers, she cursed Geralt in the name of the Lionhead Spider, which she called the Black Legba. Whether this meant she was also responsible for the misdeeds of the other villagers is unclear."
"3","Adalbert","Human","Male","Soldier"," Order of the Flaming Rose Vizima City Guard","Adalbert was a crossbowman of the City Guard who fought in the ranks of the Order of the Flaming Rose.He participated in fierce battles to take control of the Trade Quarter, resulting in the Order winning a Pyrrhic victory. A seriously wounded Adalbert went with his remaining strength to the Cloister of the Flaming Rose in the Temple Quarter. Being in a state of agony, he informed Jacques de Aldersberg what happened, and then told the Master about the death of Roderick de Wett caused by Geralt. The Grand Master then thanked the soldier for his faithful service, just before Adalbert died from his wounds."
"4","Adam","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Adam was the local poet in Murky Waters, his skills in that area were suspect at best. He was also not so secretly in love with Alina, was considered a fool by Alina's father Tobias Hoffman, and the rest of the village did not seem to have too high an opinion of him either. His occupation, other than aspiring poet, was unknown.Although his true love was ripped from this life by her jealous sister, Adam still clung to the dream of being eternally with Alina. It was during the first lonely days in a rat infested cell that Adam finally found his muse, and penned a poem for Alina.The example above is his finest work, ever, really. In a few conversations, we really get to plumb the depths of his oeuvre. It is bad enough that, at one point, Geralt asks him to simply stop speaking. Here is the poem which prompts the outburst:It might go on, but the witcher just stops him there."
"5","Adda the White","Human (turned into striga as a result of a curse, disenchanted by Geralt of Rivia)","Female",NA,NA,"Dyed red (games)Adda the White was the daughter of Foltest, king of Temeria. She was born a striga as a result of a curse cast by either Ostrit (a local magnate who loved her mother) or Sancia (Foltest's mother). The magnate was in love with the king's sister, the mother of the princess, whose name was also Adda. When he learned of the incestuous relationship between the king and his sister, Ostrit tried to put a curse on the king and this is blamed for Adda's transformation into a striga. However, Foltest's mother was also furious at the incestuous relationship between her children and may also have cursed their child. So it is possible that either Ostrit or Sancia, or both, were the cause of the curse.Adda was named for her mother who died during the birth. Her nickname ""the White"", which came from the color of her hair after the curse was removed by Geralt, served to distinguish her from her mother, Adda of Temeria, and Adda of Cidaris, the wife of king Goidemar. She was also left mentally impaired, so while she remained the logical heir to the Temerian throne, the continuation of the royal line begun by Geddes was possibly at its end.While Adda's human form was fully restored, her mind was left terribly degraded by trauma, and she is still in danger of relapse. To ward off the curse, Geralt instructed the princess to wear an amulet necklace and told her keeper to have her participate in rituals designed to ward off the curse.[1]Unfortunately, even though Adda's curse was lifted, she remained intellectually impaired. It was also then that her hair became white, which earned her the name ""Adda the White"".In the non-canon short story Cos sie konczy, cos sie zaczyna, Adda seems to have recovered sufficiently from her curse to have become the queen of Temeria.In the Temerian Dynasty, additional material written by Andrzej Sapkowski and published on his official website, Adda was described as white-haired and intellectually impaired. However, in the game and in the English translation of the short story The Witcher, her hair is red and there is no explanation for the change in her mental state.The princess had grown into a pretty, if some what wild and spoiled girl whom Geralt met at Leuvaarden's reception, where she was accompanied by the ever attentive Roderick de Wett. If Geralt refused to have sex with her she then reveals a small tidbit about her intentions regarding her father's crown.According to the Professor's notes, Adda collaborated with Salamandra. She was behind the counterfeiting of the royal seal[2] and forged the proclamations of the state of emergency, and therefore was responsible for the chaos in the Trade Quarter. She was promised the throne of Temeria, though in reality Salamandra believed her to be unpredictable and would not likely have honored that bargain. The organization planned to break the alliance.When Ostrit put a curse on Adda, he described the process in his diary. Whoever possessed the diary may renew the curse and transform Adda back into a striga. But Adda is not only dangerous as a striga, she is equally dangerous with the power she wields as a princess. It is only thanks to Triss' intervention that Geralt managed to escape Adda's (manicured) claws by the skin of his teeth.Adda wants catoblepas meat, rare is best. To obtain the item, speak to Velerad, the burgomeister, but do not forget some strong alcohol to loosen his tongue. Then he will point you in the direction of Thaler, who wants a letter from a chest in the nearby alcove before revealing any more information. Finally, speak to Triss, as she can conjure the necessary gift for the princess.Adda is a mentioned-only, secondary character in the second game.The book The Temerian Royal Dynasty provides in-game information about Adda. If you have imported a saved game before starting, then the journal entry added by that book is based on the choices made in that game (otherwise Adda is dead by default).One of Chorab's tales is about Geralt lifting the curse from Adda for the first time.If Adda was killed in the original gameIf Adda was spared in the original gameIf Adda was spared in the first game:If Geralt saved Adda in the first game, then she is still Queen of Redania, though the developers decided not to introduce her in The Witcher 3 and explore her plotline further.[3] She is mentioned only in an old letter, found in the courtyard of the Royal Palace in Vizima, where some Alyssandra Deviel wrote to Roderick de Wett on how to revive the curse.Adda is a Northern Realms leader in the Homecoming version."
"6","Alina","Human",NA,NA,NA,"Alina was a young girl from Murky Waters and the daughter of the village chief, Tobias Hoffman. She was to be married to Julian, a rich merchant from Kovir, much to the disgust of her jealous sister Celina and the poet Adam, who was secretly in love with her.She can initially be found in her house in the village of Murky Waters. Later, once she becomes a noonwraith, she usually hangs out near the ruin mill in the Fields.She seemed strangely resigned to marrying Julian and appeared fond of him, at least in a way, but she also showed no intention whatsoever of ending her affair with Adam which she carried on every day at noon, in the raspberry patch in the fields. She did seem jealous of Celina's attempts to gain Julian's attention, even though this last endeavor was proving fruitless.She had also developed quite an attachment to Alvin. She would have dearly loved to have adopted him and raise him with Julian, but Julian was not so taken with the prospect of raising a child who was, from all reports, a source.The jealous rivalry with her sister reached a peak one day when Celina started to argue with her, near the Raspberry patch, and ended up pushing Alina down and causing Alina to hit her head on a rock, killing her instantly. Because she was murdered in this manner, Alina arised as a noonwraith, doomed to forever roam the fields."
"7","Alvin","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Alvin was a boy who managed to escape the barghest attack which cost his foster mother her life. As a result of the shock, he started to divine the future and uttered the Prophecy of Ithlinne. It is supposed that Alvin was a Source, having magical powers he couldn't control.Alvin lived with Abigail until the Reverend snatched him while collecting water for Abigail. The preacher gave the orphan to a group of Salamandra lackeys, who demanded that the dwellers of the Outskirts surrender their children.In Chapter III, Geralt finds Alvin a second time. This time the boy is being held at St. Lebioda's Hospital, until he is kidnapped by Salamandra once again. In Chapter IV, Geralt finds the boy a third time, in the village of Murky Waters.Many fans of the game believe that Alvin is actually the Grand Master of the Order, Jacques de Aldersberg. When the fight between the elves under Toruviel and the Order of the Flaming Rose erupts in full force in the village of Murky Waters, Alvin teleports himself away because he is frightened by an elven warrior. Alvin's ability to teleport himself through time and space stems from the fact that he is a source. It is widely theorized that he flees to the past, perhaps back to where he was raised, and ultimately incorporates what he had learned with Geralt, accepting his perceived fate and becoming the Grand Master.Clues that speak to this hypothesis include the dimeritium pendant Alvin wears. Alvin, the boy has one as does the Grand Master; only difference is that Aldersberg's amulet shows years of wear. But the previous hint, that he went back to time with everything, clothes, knowledge etc. explains it. Another hint lies in the mention that Alvin's favorite game is ""kill the elf"" where he always plays the Grand Master and wins. Also, when Jacques' group comes to the aid of the refugees in the Swamp Cemetery (Chapter V), Jacques tells Geralt that he was returning a favour by saving the witcher's life, possibly referring to Geralt rescuing Alvin from kidnappers in Chapters I and III, killing the Devourer who attacks Alvin in Chapter IV or slaughtering the barghests hunting Alvin at the beginning of Chapter I. In the same conversation, Jacques is suspiciously quick to accuse Geralt of preachiness; not a common trait of Geralt's, but one he must show when acting as a father-figure to Alvin. Jacques also mentions that he knows about Geralt from ""a source"", which could be wordplay hinting at his past. In addition some of Jacques conversation in Ice Plains reflects the choices you tell Alvin in the Murky Waters area (for example that ""a person's gift should be used for good of others"", to which the Grand Master repeats the same comment in first person and says he was told that many times by the Witcher), it would be impossible for the Grand Master to know that conversation unless he was Alvin (or somehow met Alvin after the events of Murky Waters). Furthermore, if you chose to send him with Triss, instead of saying he taught himself to use the power she will instead say ""he uses magic wildly, like someone who began magic lessons but never finished them."" which implies that your choices with Alvin affect Jacques.Some feel that a counter-argument to this hypothesis is that townspeople in Chapters II and III already speak of Jacques de Aldersberg despite the fact that Alvin is in the care of Geralt and either Triss or Shani at that time and place, suggesting that they are two different people. Others feel that the two co-existing does not violate any time-travelling principles. One possible inconsistency is that Alvin has blonde hair and Jacques de Aldersberg has brown hair. However, children born with blonde hair in real life often darken to a middle brown as they grow up, so this difference in hair color is not prohibitive.In the scene where Alvin tells Geralt that he wants to be a witcher, the player can answer ""Don't become a witcher, become a knight"" to which Alvin replies ""I will be a Witcher-Knight!"" suggesting a knight who hunts monsters, as the Order of the Flaming Rose does. Furthermore, during a dialogue with Siegfried, Geralt learns that even a witcher can become a member of the Order.In the Fields in Chapter IV, the player must choose a piece of advice to give to Alvin. Whichever advice you choose, it will be parroted back to Geralt by Jacques in the Epilogue, which is highly suggestive. The Quests section of the Journal even notes the correlation: ""The Grand Master's words seem familiar, though I'm not sure to what..."" For more information on this correlation, see below.After defeating Azar Javed, Geralt has the option to ask Triss about Jacques. She tells him that he never had any education of sorcery and learned to use the Power by himself. It is very unlikely that Alvin was adopted by someone with knowledge as Triss' after going back in time, so if he learned to use the Power, it can be assumed it was self-taught.At the end of the game, if the King of the Wild Hunt is allowed to take Jacques de Aldersberg's soul, he tells Geralt that he knew this soul under another name as well, possibly pointing to Alvin, although his name is not explicitly uttered. Also, all of the lessons given to Alvin by Geralt appear to have had a major influence on the Aldersberg's expressed views during the endgame speeches.Alvin appears in the Icy Wasteland in the Epilogue. Perhaps he is summoned by Geralt, perhaps by Jacques, he quickly disappears without a chance to begin a dialogue with him Meeting Dandelion after the final confrontation, Geralt brings this question up himself. The two conclude that they will never know for sure.The following is from the official game guide released by CDProjekt: ""The mist is no more and you appear back in the courtyard. Fights are ending and the political situation is stabilizing. Search the body of Jacques de Aldersberg, powerful and insane man, who he was a short while ago. Now he is no more, he doesn't exist - he is dead. Take the last part of the Witchers' secrets and the strange amulet, very similar to the one you gave to Alvin in Murky Waters. Where did Alvin go? What happened to the poor boy?""The game guide also describes what the Grand Master will say depending on what Geralt said to Alvin on the topics of destiny, other races and witchers. These fan speculations have neither been confirmed nor denied by the developers.As noted above, the player's choice of advice to give to Alvin in Chapter IV determines the content of a specific conversation with Jacques de Aldersberg in the Epilogue (the one following the confrontation with Abigail's shade), suggesting that Jacques is Alvin. Alvin asks Geralt what he should do about his visions of people dying; Jacques tells Geralt that his Grand Plan (created in response to his visions of people dying) was in keeping with Geralt's earlier advice to Alvin.Alvin asks, ""I want them to like me. I don't want them to die. What should I do?""If Geralt tells Alvin, ""Your visions are a gift, not a curse. It's up to you to use them for good,"" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:If Geralt tells Alvin, ""Destiny isn't everything. We are masters of our own fate,"" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:If Geralt tells Alvin, ""Keep your gift a secret. The lives of the gifted are rarely easy,"" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:During the conversation about Berengar, Alvin says, ""Witchers are brave. They never go ill.""If Geralt tells Alvin, ""Wouldn't you rather be a knight?"" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:If Geralt tells Alvin, ""We never get sick, but that costs us. And then there's pain... Would you like to hurt badly?"" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:If Geralt tells Alvin, ""It's not true that witchers are never afraid. Besides, none remain who can complete the mutation..."" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:Lastly, Alvin asks, ""Geralt, why are the elves doing this?""If Geralt tells Alvin, ""The elves refuse to concede that the world has changed. They cannot win but still they fight. It's their sad, desperate attempt at halting evolution."" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:If Geralt tells Alvin, ""They're fighting for their freedom, for an ideal. Humans have them up against a wall and they see no other way..."" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:If Geralt tells Alvin, ""They've lost their lofty, beautiful veneer. One can clearly see the deep hatred they hold for humans."" then the conversation in the Epilogue appears as follows:It is potentially 'telling' that a private conversation between Geralt and Alvin can influence Jacques' statements in this way. However, the argument that Jacques and Alvin share a core identity is made rather circular by the notion that the Ice Wastes are populated with manifestations of memories and thoughts, recalling the trope of 'conversations with oneself', wherein one does not know whether to trust a vision that may come entirely from one's subconscious. (Jacques has extraordinary raw power that could simply be used to craft convincing dialogue based on what he can detect of the effectively 'captive', at least while 'within' the Wastes, Geralt's memories and personal connections.)After a long time. The theory of Alvin being Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg was confirmed in final part of Geralt's trilogy, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, in secondary quest Message from an Old Friend where bookseller Marcus Thaddeus Knut Hodgson tells the witcher about message that someone left him long time ago. This letter is named Letter from ""A"" and is placed inside the book titled My Manifesto - The Life of Jacques de Aldersberg."
"8","Angus","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Angus was a local drug dealer who was known to the City Guard, well, at least to Jethro. He was a shady character who can usually be found standing on the corner near The Hairy Bear, the kitty-corner from the Eager Thighs brothel, or in the slums of the Temple Quarter.Geralt must find Angus and get from him information about the Salamandra drug trade in Vizima. It is from him that Geralt gets the information to locate the Salamandra hideout where the manufacture of fisstech seems to be based. He can get this information either by paying the dealer for a letter of recommendation in order to enter the drug lab with minimal fuss or taking that same letter from him by force. Alternatively, our hero can simply enter the lab using force and dispense with the letter altogether."

Her cousins, Buse, Corbin and Ramerot are in hiding in the refugee caves in the swamp cemetery after incurring the disfavour of the king and they are completely out of orens.When Geralt speaks to Antoinette, she mentions that she recognizes Geralt because in her home many years ago, she saw him dancing all night with a sorceress that he was very fond of.Geralt doubts this due to his inability to dance. Antoinette questions if all Witcher's have white hair; Geralt says he is the only one, and she says she must be confused because she remembers him dancing with a sorceress."
"10","Azar Javed","Human","Male","Alchemist Mage"," Salamandra","Azar Javed was a Zerrikanian sorcerer and alchemist who took part in Salamandra's attack on Kaer Morhen. Initially known only as the ""mysterious mage"", he and the Professor were the main instigators of the raid on the fortress and were uniquely responsible for the theft of the witchers' secrets.Azar was one of the highest ranking Salamandra, but not the ultimate leader. While he was certainly responsible for the mutants plaguing Vizima, he was only following a grander plan, conceived by someone else.Early in his life he studied at a magical school but was expelled due to unknown reasons.At some point he made an alliance with Jacques de Aldersberg and attacked Kaer Morhen alongside the Professor, Savolla and his frightener, and some other Salamandra thugs. The attack was a success and Javed managed to steal the witchers' secrets.Later in Vizima, he noticed that Geralt started working with detective Raymond Maarloeve which he already had history with, so he sent some assassins to scare Raymond and get him to hide for a while, sometime after that he killed the detective and disguised himself as him and contacted Geralt. He then gave the witcher the last Sephirot he needed to open the tower before they went to visit the tower.The two then start to fight but, being out in the swamps and being a fire mage, Azar called on the Professor for help, who proceeded to poison Geralt with manticore poison before the two then fled the battle.Azar and Geralt later confronted each other yet again when the witcher discovered one of Salamandra's hideouts, but Azar fled once more.Azar then took to hiding out at the main hide out at the Old Manor but the witcher soon tracked him down there and the two had one final confrontation, ultimately leading to Azar's death.Mysterious MageAzar Javed"
"11","Berengar","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher"," School of the Wolf Salamandra","The witcher that was first mentioned by Vesemir, Berengar had left Kaer Morhen before Geralt's arrival.After a long search through the swamp, Geralt finds a cloven Salamandra medallion, along with Berengar's belongings leading him to conclude that Berengar must be dead. However, in Chapter IV, Geralt finds Berengar, still very much alive just outside of Murky Waters.Berengar and Geralt work together briefly, before Berengar explains why he left Kaer Morhen. He voices his disdain for the Witchers, whom he holds responsible for denying him a normal life. Later, on Black Tern Island, Berengar confronts Geralt with the intention of challenging him to a duel, forcing Geralt to choose once again, his next course of action.If he spares Berengar, then Geralt will have an ally to aid in the final battle with Azar Javed. If he duels with Berengar (as Geralt tells Berengar, just before the fight), only one can come out alive and Geralt prevails. This leaves Geralt with Berengar's remaining belongings, which include a powerful medallion, so powerful in fact, that Azar Javed cannot fail to notice it in the final battle.Note that when Azar Javed kills Berengar (if Geralt spared him earlier), the powerful medallion cannot be found on his corpse.It is actually possible to prevent Azar Javed from killing Berengar at the end of Chapter V, but nothing happens between Geralt and Berengar if this is the case. When the player clicks on Berengar, the witcher says: ""I needed time to think"" as a normal NPC would do, no choice dialogues appear. If Geralt returns to the Laboratory in the catacombs of the Old Mansion, Berengar is still standing there as if the game never expected the player to prevent Berengar's death.Berengar is implicated in the following quests:There is no additional entry to Berengar's character section if the player prevents Javed from killing him.Although deceased, Berengar is indirectly involved in the Kaer Morhen quest Berengar's Blade. The quest cannot be triggered if Geralt already has the silver blade Tor'haerne in his possession. Also, while doing the Contract: Doors Slamming Shut, Geralt can tell his contract giver which school he belongs to. When answering he belongs to the school of the Wolf, Count Kurt Dysart will tell him he once knew a witcher from the school of the wolf, his name beginning with the letter B, possible referring to Berengar."

This turned harder than expected – Myrgtabrakke had a baby and was protected by golden dragon Villentretenmerth who injured Boholt's head during the fight.By the time of 1271, when Kennet and Gar met again with Geralt, they could tell him only a sad tale of what became of their leader after the dragon hunt. They said to him that Boholt lost his memory after taking a spill and hitting his head on a rock. While he could ""still be a beast in battle"", he did nought much else and even lost his interest in women.[2]He eventually recovered some of his memories and started training new Reavers, including Jamor and Auwry.[3]"

Since Salamandra had moved into town, no one was safe. In Working Girls, she asked the witcher to help three of her girls who were being menaced.She was one possible choice of guest to invite to Shani's party, though probably not a welcome one.

This left the witcher no other choice than to find out for himself.It was not Geralt's investigation however, that revealed the werewolf's identity.

However, it is extremely difficult to kill a headhunter and since killing one only summons another, the best solution is to run away before killing any guards (eventually they do revert to their non-hostile state) or pay up."

"33","Julian Alfred Pankratz","Human","Male","Bard"," Geralt's company Redanian Secret Service University of Oxenfurt","Unnamed uncleJulian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as Dandelion (Polish: Jaskier), was a poet, minstrel, bard, and close friend of Geralt of Rivia.Not much is known about Dandelion's family except that he was of noble birth and was a cousin of Ferrant de Lettenhove, the royal instigator of Kerack.[3]He received his early education in a temple school, where, according to Geralt, literacy was ""beaten into him with a cane"". However, he didn't truly get into poetry until he was 19, after being inspired by his love for Countess de Stael.[4]Dandelion studied the seven liberal arts for four years at Oxenfurt University before later becoming a professor, but only taught students for a year before leaving the academy to travel the world. He would, however, visit Oxenfurt from time to time to give guest lectures.Within a very few years he gained worldwide fame and became known as one of the best minstrels in the Northern Kingdoms, with his best known song was the Ballad of the Lion Cub of Cintra.Dandelion first met Geralt at a fête in the town of Gulet in Aedirn. There, the poet had knocked up a girl under the musician's podium, and her four sturdy brothers were looking for him all over town, threatening to geld him and cover him in pitch and sawdust.The so called Valley of Flowers seemed just right the right location for the duo's swift escape, as it was supposed to be the edge of the inhabited world, the last outpost of civilization. It was in the small town of Upper Posada, located in a part of the Northern Realms that later became Dol Blathanna, that the pair had their first adventure together, involving a nasty Sylvan and an encounter with Dol Blathanna's native inhabitants, the Elves. During this adventure, Dandelion received his priceless lute from Toruviel.[5]Later, Dandelion was in Vizima and heard word of Geralt being injured and recovering at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander. He visited the temple and spoke to Nenneke, trying to win her favour, despite her annoyance of him flirting with one of the priestesses.After, he went and saw Geralt and the two spent time discussing Dandelion's education, as well as the lack of work for the witcher. Later that day, the two left for the city of Ellander. Once they arrived in the city, they were confronted by Dennis Cranmer, Arthur Tailles and Count Falwick, and Geralt was forced to duel Tailles. After the conflict the witcher and the bard returned to the temple and said their goodbyes before leaving.At some point Dandelion offered his services to the Redanian Secret Service, though it seemed his loyalty was dubious at the least, as he also collaborated with Temerian agents and special forces.During his travels with Geralt, Dandelion started to write his memoirs, entitled ""Half a Century of Poetry""; twice, in fact. His first attempt was lost in the bottom of the duchess of Toussaint's closet after the poet was banished from her duchy. But rather than bemoaning that loss, the poet decided to rewrite his memoirs from scratch. His poems were later bound in two collections: The Adversities of Loving and Time of the Moon.Dandelion was contacted by Ciri for aid in fixing a phylactery, which could either be used to cast or lift a curse; Ciri kept her objective to herself and Dandelion was unwilling to pry any further. Unfortunately, with mage hunts going on in Novigrad, Dandelion decided to turn to Whoreson Junior, a member of the Big Four crime lords of Novigrad. Junior agreed to find someone to repair the phylactery but for a steep price: he wanted Dandelion to steal Sigi Reuven's treasure and who was another Big Four.Dandelion eventually conjured up a plan with the help of Dudu and Kalkstein and while he succeeded in getting the treasure, the commander of the Temple Guard, Caleb Menge, found out and took the treasure for himself. Believing the bard had betrayed him, Whoreson Junior's men chased Dandelion and Ciri all the way to Temple Isle. Ciri manged to barely escape from being killed by teleporting away, but Dandelion was unfortunately captured by Menge's men and was jailed while Menge waited to publically execute the bard on Oxenfurt.In the game, Dandelion is an avid dice poker player, a sharper rank. From Chapter III onward, Geralt can play him for the sheer pleasure of the game and orens, but officially, it is only in Chapter IV that he can play the bard as part of the Sharper quest.Dandelion first appears in Flotsam as he's about to be hanged at the main square for debauchery and burning down one of Flotsam's buildings. Geralt, Triss, and Vernon Roche (for whom Dandelion has secretly been working as a spy) come across this scene and deal with the problem."

"41","Eskel","Human (witcher)","Male","Witcher"," School of the Wolf","Eskel was a witcher of the School of the Wolf taught by Master Vesemir at Kaer Morhen and active in the 13th century. As the sorceress Triss Merigold noticed, Eskel emanated a strong magic aura. Though less famous than his peer Geralt of Rivia, Eskel became renowned in his own right as a professional, reliable witcher, and possessing a kind and relaxed disposition.Eskel and the White Wolf were like brothers. Side by side they grew up, enjoyed pastime activities and endured the witcher trials. A good friend of younger Lambert and Coën of Poviss, Eskel saw Vesemir as both a mentor and a father figure. He returned to Kaer Morhen each winter to swap tales and rejuvenate for The Path.Born in mountains, Eskel originated from hill-folk. His mother used to sing him an old hiking tune about a hen, which would later be the only thing the witcher remembered of her.[1]Under unknown circumstances, The Witchers' Settlement in the Blue Mountains eventually became his home. He befriended Geralt, a peer who gradually turned into his almost-brother. Together they relished in childish delinquencies. Once, Eskel and Geralt had captured a huge forest bumblebee and tied it to a jug. Watching its antics, the two had fits of laughter until Vesemir had caught and punished them with a leather strap.[2]Tirelessly studying all sorts of creatures, trainees got to hear teachers repeat jokes about virgins and unicorns or basilisks and mirrors, quickly finding all unamusing. The one they found most primitive—infinite versions of how a young witcher shook his hand with a female dragon.[3] To become full-fledged witchers, the youth had undergone murderous and painful Changes together, the Trial of the Grasses which changed their physiology, granting them, among other things, cat-like vision in the dark. Young Eskel feared for his friend's life when Geralt's hair turned white as a side effect of the Trial, though both managed to beat the odds and survive it together. They trained on The Trail. Leading around the Kaer Morhen through dangerous obstacles, it was generally known as ""The Killer"".[4]Eskel propped by Lambert, moments after receiving distorting scars.In the late 1210s, Eskel saved a prince of Caingorn in a dire struggle with a werebbubb gang and was offered anything he wanted as a reward. Given such a wide-open choice, he could not think of anything and instead recited the fabled Law of Surprise ""give me that which you find at home yet do not expect"" that he had heard Vesemir repeat over the years.This is how Princess Deidre Ademeyn born during an eclipse became his surprise child. Avoiding responsibility, Eskel took great pains to evade going back. Taking ridiculously long routes to avoid the proximity of Caingorn, he had heard about Deidre maturing into a highly unpredictable lass. Plus she discovered an innate gift of obstructing magic in her area, all superstitiously interpreted as ""accursed mutations of the Black Sun"". To determine what it all meant, Eskel carried a collective work about the phenomenon. He surmised the Council of Wizards meddled too much into state affairs, botched it and, had they not sent Sabrina Glevissig, Ademeyn might not have become ostracized.When she sought asylum around 1242,[N 2] Vesemir hosted her and Eskel busied himself with a kikimore hatchery in the old mine outside Kaer Morhen while devising a solution and where Geralt found him and the two discussed the situation. In a way, Eskel cared and didn't want to pass her to Glevissig who, bursting with unproven conclusions, wished to kill and study Ademeyn. After heading back, Vesemir called his pupils to present ideas. Eskel, unsure, asked Geralt for guidance.If the witchers chose not to help Deidre: The witchers decided not to help her, and Deidre went into a rage, almost fatally attacking Eskel before fleeing, with Sabrina stepping in to heal Eskel's wounds, though unable to remove his deep facial scars. She requested the witchers leave it for her to find and deal with Deidre. It is unknown if the witchers allowed this, but for the next two years, the notorious and murderous outlaw Deidre terrorized southern Kaedwen. Eventually she was hunted down and killed, either by Sabrina and her allies or a mysterious man with a terribly scarred face who refused to collect the bounty that had accumulated on her.If the witchers chose to help her: A scuffle between Ademeyn and her younger brother Merwin Ademeyn, Glevissig's misguided ally poised to rule, caught Eskel inside. Accidentally, the princess slashed the witcher across his face, but deeply regretting it, she subsequently left, resolving the entire matter. Several years later she sent him a letter with her royal seal upon it, but Eskel put it into a fire without reading it and never spoke of her again.Though the witchers of Kaer Morhen never spoke of her again, none of them forgot her either, each carrying her memory in their heart.[5]Early autumn 1264 had seen Eskel return again for the winter. A certain day, he went to close the main gate to stop heat from escaping when Geralt brought Ciri. Eskel embraced the Wolf and though he was skeptical at first, he nonetheless agreed with Ciri's training. He welcomed the girl at Kaer Morhen and took her luggage. Asked who else was inside besides Vesemir, Eskel responded with the names of Lambert and Coën, their mate[4] from the School of the Griffin.[6] Following months, Eskel helped Ciri train. He was worried, however, by her trances induced by an accidental sip of White Gull.[4]The third trance scared the witchers most, so they sat down. Eskel, who couldn't withstand the silence, swore and stood up to bring a bottle of something strong. Listening to Coën and Geralt, he took a vodka. Vesemir was furious about the booze in the beginning but later beckoned Eskel to pour him a pint. After more silence, Eskel came up with an idea to summon a witch. When Lambert mocked Ciri's latest prophecy by stating witchers are likely to die by monster teeth, he added dental gangrene may be another interpretation, seemingly serious. Vesemir hushed both, saying they shouldn't joke about it.[3]They decided to call Triss Merigold who arrived near Midinváerne of 1265. The sorceress noticed Eskel emanated potent magic when he bowed and politely took her hand to kiss it. Initially suspicious she could be poised to reveal witchers' secrets to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, Merigold convinced Eskel of having no such intention. He had a good relationship with Merigold altogether. When she had comments on how witchers treat Ciri, he listened. After determining what to do about Ciri, Merigold told the witchers about the situation in the Northern Kingdoms. Early on, Eskel asked several questions but ceased to as it turned into a dispute about neutrality.[4]Eskel wintering at the keep.Before 1267, Yennefer of Vengerberg visited Kaer Morhen and Eskel met her.[4] As the Second Northern War had neared its end, Eskel was in the vicinity of Brenna. After the massive battle of Brenna, he asked about Coën, who had fought for the North. Not only did he learn the jolly friend's fate, but Eskel retrieved a silver sword once held by Coën,[6] though not the one he had at Brenna.[7] The sword retrieved would then be displayed in the main hall of Kaer Morhen.[6]He never gained Geralt's renown, even though he equaled the White Wolf in experience and skill. Despite that, Eskel has made a name for himself as an efficient witcher, learned in his trade. One of his recognized heroics was when he saved a little girl from a basilisk, splitting it down the stomach and getting her out. He wasn't paid due to the fact he was wandering those lands hunting zeugl. He didn't avoid adventures either, as he had slept with a succubus and took fisstech with her.[1] During warmer times at Kaer Morhen, Eskel would go out to drive back harpies.[8]Eskel during the Salamandra heist.One day before Belleteyn of 1270, Eskel and Lambert were both at Kaer Morhen and were supposed to repair one staircase, which they postponed. A day later, Eskel and Vesemir were out hunting in the woods and found the unconscious Geralt, till then considered dead, not far from the keep. They loaded him on a cart and while his friend laid exhausted, Eskel explained how nobody knew where he disappeared following the Rivian Pogrom. Reassuring amnesiac Geralt that all would be well, they brought him to Lambert and Triss Merigold back at the keep.Shortly thereafter, Azar Javed and the mysterious Salamandra struck. Eskel, like all his comrades, defended the keep. Splitting, Vesemir assigned Eskel and Lambert to help him battle Savolla's frightener. Nevertheless, the thugs got the upper hand. Witchers retreated into the upper courtyard, where Merigold blamed Eskel and Lambert for not repairing that staircase as it could have helped the defense. When she also said Salamandra may be there for witcher mutagens, Lambert was skeptical but Eskel supported her. Though he helped slay the frightener, the bandits got away with the mutagens.After they burned the murdered trainee Leo on a funeral pyre, the witchers split up to seek information. Eskel took western direction as he had contacts there and preferred coast climate. Before leaving, Eskel gave Geralt valuable advice on fencing and alchemy.[7]Executing a forktail.Through the year that followed the defeat of the mastermind behind Salamandra, Jacques de Aldersberg, Eskel had several contracts. He pierced a fogler, fought a red-skinned insectoid or flamed four wraiths.[9] Next, he had been hired to deal with a hypnotic samovila but left after the peasant who paid fell in love with her.On a search for a katakan more than a century old and liable to kill drunkards, Eskel had to stalk the opponent for a month before dealing the final blow. Including trying to trap it a masquerade ball held by the nobles to attract the vampire, during which he took the time to enjoy the company of a number of the ladies there. He eventually managed to trick it into drinking blood from a woman he paid to be heavily intoxicated with substances that would weaken it. After that he managed to kill it with ease and took its carcass back to Kaer Morhen with him. Proper examination of the vampire's body parts, he believed, could lead to discovering a new witcher method of age determination based on footsteps.[1]Eskel was out pursuing a forktail in the fall of 1272 as the draconid needed to be removed and Yennefer lacked organs to distill ingredients required to disenchant Uma. After Geralt tracked Eskel down, Eskel agreed to let the White Wolf join the hunt and the two talked about recent events going on in their lives before tracking and following the forktail to its lair and finishing it off. Then Eskel mounted his horse and the two made their way back to the keep with a friendly horse race.Inside, Eskel showed Geralt the katakan specimen and began its autopsy. Later on, as Yennefer started the transformation process on Uma, Eskel was noticeably troubled by Uma being put through the Trial of the Grasses and eventually walked off from it. Though he did return and brought some rags to help clean the floor, and Yennefer after she prompted him, as Uma had vomited on her during the Trial. After Yennefer broke Uma's curse and went to rest, Eskel sat with Lambert to share anecdotes and drink when Geralt joined them.Eskel goes toe to toe with Caranthir.As Eredin Bréacc Glas realized Ciri was on Kaer Morhen, he attacked and Eskel partook in the ensuing battle. He defended the inner courtyard of the keep. After Caranthir opened a portal and brought a few riders of the Wild Hunt through, Eskel dueled Caranthir, holding his own expertly, until Caranthir utiilized his teleporting, which almost cost him his life. Luckily, this did not happen as fate smiled upon him—Ciri saved his hide. Caranthir retreated after being called away, but not before he ordered his troops to kill the two. Eskel and Ciri then killed the warriors and continued to fend off the Hunt.Suddenly, icy coldness tore through holes opened by the Wild Hunt, freezing Eskel in motion. He only unfroze after Eredin and the Aen Elle warriors vanished, ousted by Ciri's outbreak of power in the wake of Vesemir's death.[1]In the battle's aftermath, Eskel bid a last farewell to his valiant master. Unable to imagine Kaer Morhen without Vesemir, he decided to watch over the Witchers' Settlement until winter 1273 and return to the Path for an unknown amount of time. Direction—Lormark. He supposed its warlike undertone would provide ample work opportunities.[1]In July 1267, Ciri experienced a pyromantic vision with a fraction of it showing Eskel and other witchers led onto a scaffold.[10] She had seen Eskel again in a different vision after entering Tor Zireael.[11] When recounting the story about Yennefer, Geralt and herself to Galahad, Ciri changed the end to a happy one, telling the naive knight from another world that, after the pogrom, a splendid feast took place with Eskel in attendance.[3]Elsewhere, bard Dandelion introduced a ballad Bitter, Evil Hearts, chronicling the tale of Eskel and Ademeyn.[5] A story about how Eskel saved the little girl from a Basilisk made it into A Few Remarks on Basilisks and Cockatrices, a book containing useful knowledge for beast hunters.[1] Decades on, by the 14th century, he had become a part of various iterations of the legend of the White Wolf and the witcher girl.[3]Eskel uses Igni against the Hunt.The Wolf witcher had a menacing, metallic voice that sounded like a dog's barking to Ciri when she first heard it. The most prominent feature of his visage was a long, hideous, semi-circular scar running from the corner of his mouth across the length of his cheek up to the ear. It got itchy when he was nervous or embarrassed. Minus the scar and hair color, Eskel and Geralt resembled one another like true brothers. Eskel's hands emanated powerfully with magic, with more power than the White Wolf's. This triggered pleasant, piercing vibration in mages.[4] On festive occasions, he would sport a beret adorned with pheasant feathers.[12]Eskel was calm, patient, stable, thoughtful and polite. Even when he disagreed wholeheartedly with a topic, he feigned politeness and interest in the matter. What betrayed him in such situations was avoiding eye contact. He enjoyed drinking and laughing with friends. Quite self-aware, he had no delusions about his appearance but that didn't hinder him from smiling. His fitting, mature behavior, especially when it came to Ciri compared to the other witchers endeared him to Triss Merigold.[4] Vesemir prized Eskel's reliability.[13]"
"42","Fence","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Fence is an informal term for a person who receives and disposes of stolen goods. In The Witcher, at least two people present themselves as fences: Thaler, who, as it turns out, is not actually a fence, and a tough-looking fellow in Old Vizima in Chapter V. The man in Chapter V is a fence, he is not simply effecting a cover for investigative purposes.He buys and sells pretty much anything from his location in the dark alley, west of the field hospital (other looters and various individuals also mill about there). It is possible that he is only available when Geralt first reaches Old Vizima and that he is no longer available later in Chapter V.If you are looking for information on the architectural features in the game, see palisade."
"43","Ferryman","Human","Male",NA,NA,"The ferryman can be found on the dike and on the landing in the swamp. He carries paying customers back and forth between these two locations for 5 orens a trip.Note: He is not available from the Dike at night.I also do not know if it is just my twisted mind but there seem to be a lot of allusions to bisexuality in this little exchange! When Geralt first asks Kalkstein about getting to the swamp, he asks ""Does the ferry go both ways?"". Then later at the dike, who — having played the game — can forget this exchange?Since the ferryman is involved in buying beggartick, and we know from both Vaska and the Hierophant that beggartick is used in the production of fisstech, it is possible that our chief means of transportation to and from the swamp is slightly less than legitimate in his other dealings. I wonder, does that make Geralt an accessory to the drug trade in addition to facilitating Jethro's drug habit?"
"44","Fisher King","Human","Male",NA,NA,"The Fisher King and his druid friend were followers and servants of the powerful nymph known as the Lady of the Lake.In 1270, the Fisher King lived in a modest hut on the lakeshore outside Murky Waters, serving the Lady of the Lake, and according to the hermit, helped take care of the village. He also seemed to be the postmaster for the village and handled the delivery of a letter from Geralt to his lover to Vizima. The Lady herself suggested that he was her lover, on at least one occasion.At his hut, Geralt found him to ask about borrowing his boat to get to Black Tern Island. His mostly silent nature thankfully didn't pose a problem, and he relented.[1]In 1275, the Fisher King and the hermit followed the Lady of the Lake to Lac Célavy in Toussaint. He most likely transported common, but worthy folks on the island to the Lady's islet, and collected herbs.[2]He was not a very talkative guy, and managed to communicate mostly with a series of Mhm's and Uhm's, except for when motivated to talk."

"46","Foltest","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Foltest was the king of Temeria, prince of Sodden, sovereign of Pontaria and Mahakam as well as the senior protector of Brugge and Ellander. He was the son of King Medell and Queen Sancia of Sodden, making him a member of the Temerian Dynasty.Sancia's royal connection with Sodden turned the principality into a vassal state and Ekkehard began paying tribute to Temeria after the death of Gutram. The king's Royal Council included the sorceresses Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, as well as Fercart of Cidaris, Willemer the priest, Bronibor and Hereward of Ellander.Foltest was a wise and handsome monarch. As with his predecessor, he was not fond of his grandfather, Hugo of Rivia. Upon his accession to the Temerian throne, he demanded that Hugo's portrait be removed from the throne room and had a habit of ""leaving Hugo out"" of the family genealogy. Foltest devoted plenty of time to lauding his great-grandfather, Griffin, as he was known to speak warmly of ""Grandmama Bienvenu"" and ""Great-grandmama Clarissa"". He tended to be highly evasive of any questions regarding family lineage.Although unmarried, many rumors about Foltest's romantic status circulated. From an early age, the then-prince created great scandal in the royal court by having an affair with his own sister, Adda. After ascending to the throne, he was to marry Adda and make her his queen, mortally offending King Vizimir II of Redania, who had arranged for Foltest to marry his daughter Dalimira. Adda died soon after the birth of their daughter, however, and the marriage never eventuated. The cursed child — possibly accursed by the courtier Ostrit, who was in love with Adda, but perhaps by Foltest's mother — died shortly after birth, or appeared to, until she emerged as a striga seven years later. The monster was so dangerous that Foltest was forced to move his residence elsewhere. The beast, however, remained a threat to all citizens living nearby. Foltest and his advisors at summoned a multitude of magical professionals or Knowing Ones. While most only offered a multitude of ways to kill the monster, one told of a possible ritual which could reverse the curse: sleeping within the Striga's sarcophagus till the third crowing of the cock. As no one at the time could succeed, Foltest kept the Striga alive while arbitrarily sending for mages and sorceress who might know how to reverse the spell.One day, the witcher Geralt of Rivia was taken before Foltest as he believed he could lift the curse on Adda. They discussed the contract and arranged a reward of 3,000 orens. Though they considered other options that Geralt could take, such as killing the striga, Foltest pleaded that Geralt simply cure it.Later Foltest went and visited Geralt, discussing three last matters: what process the witcher would go through to lift the curse, what he should do if he needs to defend his life, and what state Adda would be in if she survived. Geralt explained how he would lift the curse and then went on his way to Vizima and eventually succeeded.The affair between Foltest and his sister rendered him ineligible as a royal bachelor because any potential union would be tainted by the scandal. However, Foltest did not remain celibate for long. During the Second Northern War, he was secretly in love with the Baroness La Valette. It is widely rumored that both the Baroness' younger children, son Boussy and daughter Anaïs, are not the children of the old baron La Valette, but the progeny of Foltest. Adda the White is officially regarded as the successor to the Temerian throne, but the girl is clearly impaired and disabled.Foltest and King Demavend III of Aedirn joined forces to fight Nilfgaard in the second war, but Emperor Emhyr var Emreis was also prepared to fight and met their challenges blow for blow. Once the conflict came to a conclusion, he acted as one of the negotiators of the peace treaty of Cintra.In the original game, we hear about the king far in advance of any actual meeting. There is talk in the streets which suggests that the monarch is ""away"", but his specific location is never indicated. King Foltest only arrives in Chapter V, in the midst of the raging conflict in the streets of Old Vizima between the Scoia'tael and the Order of the Flaming Rose.Prior to this point, he was away and had left others to govern in his stead: Velerad for instance, and, as we find out later, Thaler.Journal entry imageHaving survived one assassination attempt at the hand of a mysterious killer thanks to the timely intervention of Geralt of Rivia, the king keeps Geralt nearby as he regards Geralt as a sort of ""good luck charm"". At the start of the game, Foltest is leading a civil war against the Baroness La Valette to claim his bastard children. He is eventually assassinated by the Kingslayer and Geralt is accused of the crime. One of Foltest's most trusted agents, Vernon Roche, assists Geralt in finding the Kingslayer. Leaving no lawful heirs, Foltest's assassination plunged Temeria into the chaos of interregnum. The threat of a full-blown civil war between the nobility and the last remaining bastard child and her supporters.In the game, Foltest has changed significantly, his clothes and face are completely different and is mostly focused on the design and art of the character - he appears more regal, colorful and distinctive. He only briefly appears (relative to the story) in the tutorial missions as flashbacks when recalling the events to Roche."

He appeared only in a 2004 video of The Witcher video game, and not in the final cut, although a model similar to his was later used for Everden of Rinde in the Side Effects add-on.In the demo, Kniprode asked Geralt for help in getting the skull of Foltest's grandfather, because there was something in the skull that would help revive his dead wife. The witcher then went to the catacombs where he ran into Halfar and his thugs, and was faced with a decision. He could either kill them or send them away, before killing a koshchey and getting back to Franz."

"52","Geralt of Rivia TV series Games","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher"," Wolf School","Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose ""Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde"", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so ""Geralt"" was all that remained of his chosen name. ""Of Rivia"" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title ""of Rivia"", which amused him.[1] He, therefore, became a true knight.Geralt was the son of the sorceress Visenna and, presumably, the warrior Korin, but when he was born Visenna left him with the School of the Wolf at Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was trained and made to be a witcher. He survived the many blistering mutations required to grant witchers their abilities and passed the Trial of the Grasses. Geralt's intensive training and the mutagenic experimentation carried out upon him, granted him considerably greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and extreme resistance to pain.Geralt was eventually put through the Trial of Forest Eyes, where he was left tied up in the woods and blindfolded and needed to return to the keep by the morning or he would fail. He was helped out of his binds by the elf Aideen, where they went to look at the non-human reservation to find the camp had been attacked by vrans. They then left and came across some Cat School witchers training and wrestling. Aideen then unbound Geralt and left him to return to his master.Later on, the Wolf School and the Cat School had a tournament between them, organized by King Radowit II who secretly plotted with the Cat School to kill the witchers from the Wolf School. In the first round, Geralt and Gweld faced off, slowly realizing while they were fighting that the whole tournament was a ruse. As they came to that realization however, a druid put a mind control spell upon Gweld which made him violently attack Geralt, forcing Geralt to kill his friend with a sword through the chest. Right after this, soldiers under Radowit's command surrounded the witchers and started to kill them all, but Geralt was able to escape on horseback, causing Radowit to put a bounty on his head.Geralt then came across Aideen again in the woods, who persuaded him not to kill the soldiers who slaughtered his fellow witchers, though he did kill one of Radowit's men that he saw along his trip back to Hertch, where he warned the elders about Radowit and the Cat School's betrayal.[2]Due to his brilliant success in training, Geralt was selected for additional mutation experiments. He was the only witcher to have survived these experiments, his stark white hair being a side effect of these additional mutations. After finishing his witcher training, Geralt set off into the world on a horse named Roach, a name he would bestow upon every one of his later horses. Thus, he became a monster slayer for hire.After about 50 miles after leaving Kaer Morhen, Geralt was anxious to kill his first monster. He came across a bald man with rotten teeth, alongside his mates, who were about to rape a young girl. The bald man prepared to rape her as his mates held back her father until Geralt came in and killed the bald man, which frightened the gang off. The young witcher expected thanks, though the reality of the situation soon set in: not only did the father flee with the gang, but the girl, with the bald man's blood on her, threw up, became hysterical, and then passed out when Geralt approached her.An unknown time later, he killed an amphisbaena and went to the court of King Idi of Kovir, where he handed in the head of the beast. However the king's mages, Zavist and Stregobor, told the king that Geralt was little more than a charlatan, so the king didn't pay the witcher anything and demanded he leave Kovir in 12 hours, which Geralt was barely able to do on account of the king's hourglass being broken.Two years later he made his way to Blaviken where the alderman, Caldemeyn, was happy to see the witcher after so many years since Geralt's last visit. While he couldn't offer a reward on a kikimore that Geralt killed nearby, his guards suggested the local mage, Irion, might have some use for it. However, when they arrived at the mage's tower, Geralt immediately saw Irion was actually none other than Stregobor. Once the witcher and mage were alone, the two discussed the past, with Geralt sardonically remarking on how Stregobor talked the former King Idi out of paying him back in Kovir. Pushing this aside, Stregobor revealed he needed Geralt's help: Renfri, a bandit and the leader of a gang, was in town looking to kill him, and therefore he wished for the witcher to kill Renfri. Unfazed by this, Geralt remarked it wasn't his problem and left.Later that night, Geralt and Caldemeyn went to The Golden Court, the town's inn and where Renfri was staying. Geralt found her gang sans leader, but none of them were very cooperative and just made jokes until one member, Fifteen, challenged him to a fight. However, before it could begin, Renfri appeared and went to talk to Geralt and Caldemeyn in private, with the latter demanding she leave town or be thrown in jail. Unperturbed, Renfri revealed a letter of safe conduct from King Audoen which gave her immunity in Hengfors and Arcsea and after another short discussion, Geralt and the alderman left.That night, as Geralt went to his guest room in Caldemeyn's home, he found Renfri there, who eventually revealed her entire past, including how Stregobor played a part in banishing the princess from her own kingdom on account of her being born during a black sun, setting into play a constant struggle between the two: her trying to kill the mage and the mage trying to kill her. She then asked Geralt to help her kill Stregobor, but the witcher once again refused to take sides. After telling her she should leave town, Renfri remarked on the Tridam ultimatum, before agreeing she'd leave the next day, but in the meantime wished to sleep with Geralt, who obliged.The next morning though, as Geralt ate breakfast with Caldemeyn and his family, the alderman revealed the deadly meaning behind the Tridam ultimatum, making Geralt realize Renfri's ruse was to take the market-goers hostage and he ran off to the market, which was preparing for its busiest day of the year. When he arrived, he found Renfri's gang, who hadn't acted yet as Renfri went off to give Stregobor the ultimatum first. Not wanting to take chances, Geralt fought with the gang, viciously killing them all off in front of the townspeople before Renfri showed up, who refused to stand down, forcing Geralt to fight and kill her as well. As she died, Stregobor appeared, having seen it all from his crystal ball, and wished to do an autopsy on the dead princess. However, Geralt threatened to slay the mage if he so much as touched Renfri's body, and thus Stregobor left to return to Kovir. The townspeople, not realizing how close they'd come to being hostages and killed off, proceeded to throw stones at Geralt for his actions until Caldemeyn stepped in to stop it. He then asked for Geralt to leave and never return to Blaviken.[3]As Geralt left the tent, he was approached by Merwin, who showed him a scroll from King Henselt of Kaedwen, who told him that Merwin was under the protection of Kaedwen and anyone defying Merwin defied the kingdom. Shortly after in the woods Geralt met Lambert, who had just killed some wolves and explained that Merton Bringgs and his group of dwarves had tried to enter the keep, but Lambert caught them. As Geralt entered the keep, he found Vesemir who informed him that Deidre had returned a couple days earlier, running from her envious brother and an evil sorceress, and that Eskel had told him that Deidre was actually his surprise child from about 20 years ago. Vesemir then told Geralt to go look for Eskel.Geralt soon found Eskel, who explained how Deidre had become his surprise child, but ultimately hadn't decided if he should hand her over to Sabrina or not. The who then made their way back to Vesemir, who decided the 4 should vote on it, with it coming down to Geralt's choice as Eskel chose to trust whatever his fellow witcher decided.If Geralt voted to keep Deidre safe: Geralt and Eskel convinced Deidre to go with them to the camp where the prince and the sorceress were. Once there though, despite Deidre agreeing she'd give up any claim to the throne and any titles and estates like her brother wanted, Sabrina then tried to have Merton arrest her. In the ensuing chaos, Deidre struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and killed Merton with her sword but Sabrina escaped through a portal. The witchers then entered a fight with Merwin's group before Geralt followed Deidre into Sabrina's tent where he found Deidre, Sabrina, and Merwin. Merwin asked Geralt to kill Deidre, but she pleaded for her life saying she didn't mean to hurt Eskel. Geralt then tried to convince Deidre to let her anger towards Sabrina and her brother go, as that was best for everyone.If Geralt told Deidre to leave the keep: Geralt and Eskel informed Deidre she had to leave, with Eskel explaining she was putting Kaer Morhen in danger by being there. Angry at this, she struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and summoned archespores, which attacked the two witchers while she ran off. After dealing with the immediate threats, Geralt informed Vesemir about the situation before going to Sabrina to get her help to heal Eskel, and giving the sorceress permission to hunt down Deidre.The rest of the winter at Kaer Morhen passed more peacefully and Geralt left come spring to continue his trade.[4]Geralt traveled to Gulet on witcher business, where he met Dandelion, a poet who later became his best friend, at a fête. Later Dandelion slept with a woman under the musicians' podium, who had four large brothers. Dandelion fled from the city with Geralt and started to build a friendship with him on their way southeast to Dol Blathanna.[3]After Gulet, Geralt and Dandelion stopped in Upper Posada to look for work, however the only ""monster troubles"" the people could come up with were tall tales and creatures that didn't actually exist, so the two soon left to find another place for work. However, on the road they were soon approached by Nettly, who'd seen them in Upper Posada, and explained he did have business for the witcher, who accepted.Geralt and Dandelion ate supper at the man's house where the group was joined by Dhun, the elder of Lower Posada, who eventually discussed a ""deovel"" named Torque, who had been somewhat helpful, if occasionally pulling pranks on the villagers, but now thing were getting out of hand and they needed something to get rid of Torque, but not kill him.Agreeing to check it out, the witcher and bard went into the nearby hemp field where the ""deovel"" was known to stay and found ""offerings"" set up for the creature. As they looked around, Torque appeared but as Geralt tried to talk with the sylvan, Dandelion started to make jokes at Torque to the point the sylvan began to pelt small, iron balls at the two, making the two runoff.After the attack, the two went back to Lower Posada where they met with Dhun and Nettly, who admitted that they had tried to outwit the ""deovel"" in the past, including trying to trick him into eating the iron pellets he'd thrown at the pair. Eventually, they brought out an old woman and her apprentice, Lille, along with an ancient book. While the old woman, a Wise One, couldn't read the book, she'd memorized it by heart from knowledge passed down to each wise woman, eventually revealing Torque was a sylvan and the reason they just wanted to drive him away was that Lille didn't want him killed.With this in mind, the next day Geralt found Torque and, after a quick game of riddles, the witcher threw an iron ball which hit Torque in the forehead. This surprise attack gave Geralt the opportunity to capture Torque and signal to Dandelion, but a horse appeared and hit him, rendering the witcher unconscious.Shortly after, Geralt woke up to find himself tied up along with Dandelion, with Torque giving Galarr, an elf from the Blue Mountains, three sacks of corn, revealing that Torque had been stealing the food to help the starving elves, as well as passing along agricultural tips he learned from the villagers as the elves didn't know how to farm the land. Noticing the awake prisoners, one of the elves, Toruviel, began to antagonize Geralt before kicking him and smashing Dandelion's lute. Angry at this latter act, Geralt managed to headbutt the elf and another moved to kill the witcher despite Torque's protests that Filavandrel aén Fidháil forbade killing, when Filavandrel himself showed up to stop everything.However, it was clear that the leader planned to have the witcher and bard killed, as they were witnesses to what Torque had been doing, though during this Filavandrel and Geralt conversed, with Geralt noting the elf was filled with hatred towards humans and, despite how his people were starving, too proud to try and cohabit with those he deemed ""inferior"". As the elves moved to shoot Geralt and Dandelion though, Torque stood in front of the pair, fruitlessly trying to defend anyone from being killed and ignoring Geralt's remark to stand aside. Feeling it was necessary, Filavandrel started to give the order to kill the three when Lille suddenly appeared, but in the form of the goddess Dana Meadbh. After silently communicating with the elves, she sent them riding back to the Blue Mountains, but not before Toruviel gave Dandelion her priceless lute for destroying his. Filavandrel then bade farewell to them, remarking Geralt was right about his earlier comments. Later that night, Geralt, Dandelion, and Torque made camp, with Geralt reading over the ancient book he'd collected as his prize for getting rid of Torque, who was moving on from Lower Posada.[3]An unknown time later, Geralt and Dandelion traveled to a village where they went fishing but the line snapped and their meal escaped. The two started to fight about who was at fault and started to leave before Dandelion realized the line had caught an old jar that he thought might contain a djinn. On realizing there was a mage's seal on the jar, Geralt tried to warn the bard not to touch it but in their scuffle, the seal came off and the djinn appeared. As Geralt grabbed his swords, Dandelion began to make wishes, which only angered the djinn and it grabbed Dandelion's throat. With his weapons doing little damage, Geralt grabbed the seal out of desperation and used the words of an exorcism a priestess had taught him and miraculously the djinn ran off.However, the bard was badly injured so Geralt hastily made for Rinde in hopes of finding someone to help. Despite Dandelion's severe injuries, anyone of low stature wasn't allowed to enter after sunset so all they could do was wait it out with the others there, including Chireadan, Errdil, and Vratimir. Eventually the group revealed there was only one known mage in town who could help: Yennefer of Vengerberg who, despite King Heribert's orders that no magic users could stay in Redania, was staying with the honorary Novigrad ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus giving her asylum while she stayed with him.As soon as sunrise hit, Geralt made his way to the ambassador's home, knocking out the doorman, Cerberus, in the process. While he searched the home for the sorceress, he ran into a drunk and naked Berrant, who mentioned a woman wanting juice before he passed out. Geralt got the apple juice, then made his way up to the sorceress' room and gave her the drink, who didn't notice at first that he was not Berrant as she was under the bed covers. However, once she appeared naked from under them, she quickly realized the situation and demanded answers from Geralt, who answered sarcastically, causing her to immediately cast a spell at him which Geralt tried to counter with Heliotrop. Desperate for her help, Geralt changed to a respectful tone, explaining why he'd intruded on her sleep, before eventually revealing the djinn and the exorcism statement he made. However, Yennefer remarked it wasn't an exorcism, just a witty, indecent comment before asking what drove the djinn away and the seal that'd been on the bottle. While Geralt noted it probably went to do one of Dandelion's wishes, he hid the truth about the seal, pretending Dandelion had it. The two then traveled by portal to Errdil's inn so that Yennefer could help the injured bard.As Yennefer worked on healing Dandelion, Geralt and Chireadan discussed the sorceress, with the two men both revealing in their own ways they found her attractive, though the elf noted that Geralt should be wary of Yennefer, as she didn't do things to help others unless she was also getting something out of it. After some time, Yennefer then called the witcher up to the room to see Dandelion only to then release a magical trap on Geralt and revealing she knew he had the seal. After some back and forth comments, Geralt gave it to her as a gesture of goodwill that he'd pay her for her help, however this was fruitless as Yennefer had something else in mind and Geralt quickly deduced she wanted to use Dandelion, who had a connection to the djinn, to try and lure it back to capture it for herself. The witcher adamantly refused to put Dandelion in danger again, but by then Yennefer's other spells took hold, paralyzing the witcher and obscuring the room in a magical shield so nobody could interfere. With that, she then told Geralt he was going to pay for her help by settling some of her accounts in Rinde before violently kissing him, which placed a hypnotic spell on the witcher before he soon lost conscious.Geralt woke to find himself in the city's dungeons with Chireadan, who revealed in his mind-controlled state that Geralt had beat up the local pawnbroker and his apprentice, spanked the local apothecary Laurelnose, took out a group of guards, then made his way to the temple while insulting the priest, Krepp, as all 3 were on the town council and had voted to kick Yennefer out of Rinde while also spreading vulgar gossip about her. However, before Geralt could make it to the temple he fainted and the guards threw him into the dungeons, with Chireadan having been caught in the chaos and thrown in as well. Just then, several guards sent by Laurelnose came in and began to beat up Geralt, but when the one throwing the punches asked if the witcher had any wishes, Geralt stated he just had one: that the guard would burst and, before another punch could be thrown, the guard's body literally burst, killing him instantly.With that, Geralt and Chireadan were brought before the mayor, Neville, with Krepp also in attendance, with the latter noting it must have been the sorceress' work as neither the witcher or elf had control of the force to do so. After revealing almost the entire story to the mayor and priest, Krepp then concluded Yennefer wanted the djinn as it would give the sorceress a great deal of power and when the conversation turned to what Geralt said that made the genie run off, Geralt repeated the supposed exorcism only for Krepp to become insulted by it. Before more could be asked on this, Dandelion suddenly fell into the room through a portal, proclaiming Geralt was innocent and that Yennefer had ordered him to state before the mayor his wish was for them to believe the witcher wasn't guilty. Krepp quickly deduced it was the sorceress' way of using the last wish to free the genie so she could capture it when the group heard a thunderous noise outside of the building and looked out to see the djinn flying above Errdil's tavern, having being magically lassoed by Yennefer. However, the djinn wasn't going down without a fight and was destroying all the nearby buildings as it tried to break free.Wishing to save Yennefer, Geralt got Krepp to cast a spell to re-open the portal Dandelion had come through but not before asking what the words of the exorcism he said earlier meant, to which Krepp paraphrased that it meant ""get out of here and go fuck yourself!"". With that, Geralt entered the portal and landed in Errdil's tavern and where Yennefer was still trying to capture the genie while her powers waned. Seeing Geralt, she opened a portal to send him away as the djinn entered the tavern through its own portal to kill the sorceress, but Geralt threw himself between the two, shielding Yennefer. Shockingly, the genie didn't attack the witcher, but appeared to roar in an unknown language at him. Trying to get Yennefer away from it, Geralt pulled the sorceress through the portal she'd opened, though she yelled and threw punches at the witcher, claiming she almost had the genie, before rushing back through the portal with Geralt trying to grab her once more. As they crashed back in the tavern, Yennefer managed to cast a spell to pin the witcher down, but Geralt, trying to save her, informed her of the truth: he was the one making the wishes as he'd been the one holding the seal when he made his first wish (the ""exorcism"") and had one wish left.As a weakened Yennefer demanded Geralt make his last wish so she could hopelessly try to capture the genie, Geralt finally realized what he wanted and that would also save Yennefer from the genie's wrath and wished their fates be tied, thus freeing the genie while preventing it from killing the sorceress. With that, the genie escaped back to its realm and Geralt and Yennefer proceeded to make love in the destroyed tavern.[3]After the events in Rinde, Yennefer and Geralt started a rather physical relationship, spending the majority of their time at Yennefer 's home in Vengerberg, Aedirn, and putting to good use a wide variety of the sorceress' collection, including a stuffed unicorn, as well as having sex in rather unusual situations, like levitating 30 fanthoms above ground. However, the witcher finally decided to leave after half a year in the city, considering Yennefer's behavior as too possessive. Unable to initiate the parting though, the witcher ran off during the night, leaving only a rose and a letter on the bed as his farewell.TBAA while later, Geralt traveled to Vizima and visited The Fox but, while in the process of trying to find a bed to rent, was attacked by three racists who didn't approve of his Rivian accent. A short fight unfolded where Geralt killed the men but right after members of the city guard appeared and attempted to arrest him, though using Axii, Geralt was able to manipulate them into taking him to Velerad, the city castellan, instead.Once he met Velerad, the pair took time discussing the real reason Geralt was passing through: King Foltest of Temeria had put out a contract to cure his daughter, Adda the White, who was cursed and turned into a striga. After Geralt went and saw Foltest, and they reached an agreement: for 3,000 orens, Geralt would try to successfully release Adda from her curse, without killing her, as many had attempted in the past. The witcher then discussed the plan further with Foltest's underlings, Ostrit, Velerad, and Segelin, who agreed the witcher should spend a night in the old city with the striga.Four days later, after talking to survivors of the beast, speaking further with Foltest, and finalizing plans, Geralt traveled to the old, abandoned palace and set up camp there, preparing his potions and meditating before he was found by Ostrit in the dead city. The magnate then tried to bribe the witcher with 1,000 orens to leave the place and never return, all while keeping the cursed Adda in her form. As Geralt questioned Ostrit's reasoning, noting a striga on the loose would make people lose faith in their king and possibly remove Foltest, the magnate grew frustrated and tried to fight the witcher, who quickly knocked out the man and tied him up.Ostrit came to shortly after and soon realized Geralt planned to use him as bait to lure out Adda. He then confessed to the witcher he did want to overthrow Foltest, but more than that, he wanted the king to suffer because Foltest had taken the one Ostrit had loved, Adda of Temeria, who was the king's own deceased sister and lover. However, he was adamant he couldn't have possibly caused the curse as he didn't know how to use magic and that Foltest and Adda's mother, Sancia of Sodden, must have done it as she too didn't agree with the incestous relationship. Geralt, however, heard the beast start to move out of her crypt and cut the magnate loose, who quickly took off to try and fruitlessly escape, but was quickly killed by the striga.Geralt and the striga then faced off against each other, though Geralt took care not to kill her, only looking to buy enough time to get her away from her crypt. Eventually managing to send her running, Geralt quickly hid himself in her tomb and closed it, casting Yrden on the cover before meditating until dawn. Awaking a few hours later, right at dawn, he slipped out of the tomb to find Adda, now in human form, lying next to the tomb. However, as Geralt checked her teeth to make sure the transformation was complete, the still transforming girl awoke and slashed deep cuts in Geralt's neck with her talons. The witcher quickly pinned her down until she completely transformed back to human, but right after Geralt fainted from the blood loss.Two days later, Geralt woke up in the new palace with Velerad looking after him, who explained they'd raced into the old palace right after dawn and found the badly injured witcher and saved him. Geralt then asked about the princess' condition and as the castellan explained she was fine, Geralt fell asleep once more.[3]After fighting and releasing the striga, Geralt traveled to Ellander to recover at the Temple of Melitele. He was cared to by and quickly developed a relationship with one of the priestesses, Iola, who was studying under Nenneke, who he ended up sleeping with, as she reminded him of Yennefer. The next morning, the two were arose by Nenneke, who didn't want them in a relationship together, so she sent Iola out to continue with her duties. The older priestess had a look at Geralt's injuries and then after some assessment, sent the witcher to go eat breakfast, before joining him again in the temple gardens.The two then discussed Iola using magic to put Geralt in a trance, and maybe reveal something about his destiny and future, though the witcher didn't want to undergo such a thing. Not long after that, Count Falwick and Arthur Tailles, members of the Order of the White Rose, arrived at the temple and confronted Geralt and Nenneke, asking the witcher to leave Ellander by the orders of Duke Hereward. Tailles' attitude was met by Nenneke who declared the temple belonged to her and she decided who came and left, threatening the young knight with a small porcelain jar that was potentially harmful. Geralt decided to tell the men of his plans to leave Ellander in the next few days and adding insult to injury, started to insult Tailles, who furiously left the temple with his partner.Geralt later went and saw Iola, explaining Kaer Morhen and his training as a witcher, as well as contracts he had taken throughout his life on the path. After spending some time alone and reading, Geralt was informed by Nenneke that Dandelion was at the temple to visit him, just before the poet turned around the corner. The two discussed recent events and Dandelion's education before the witcher bought out vodka and they started to drink, with Geralt complaining about a lack of work in the area. After his drink with Dandelion, Geralt went to the grotto in the garden and had a look at the many exotic herbs there while Nenneke harvested them. She asked him to stay a couple more days at the temple, which request was quickly turned down by the witcher, as he was preparing to leave that day.After leaving the temple with Dandelion, the witcher started to ride towards the city of Ellander before he was confronted by Falwick, Tailles and Dennis Cranmer, with Falwick declaring the young knight and the witcher must fight, as Tailles' pride had been injured at the temple. Falwick then informed Geralt that he had to throw the fight, as hitting the knight would have him arrested and thrown in front of Hereward. Geralt agreed to the fight and easily outmanoeuvred the young knight, making him hit himself in the face, which Falwick believed was worth Cranmer arresting Geralt according to his orders, but the dwarf believed that Tailles had hit himself and that wasn't worth arresting the witcher for. As Geralt prepared to leave, he threatened Falwick, saying if he ever threatened Nenneke or Cranmer again, he would die for it.The two headed back to the temple, where he prepared to travel, packing up his horse and saying his goodbyes. Iola came out and gave him his elixirs and after their hands touched, she started to suffer a seizure, which Nenneke told Geralt to ignore and leave, which he did.[3]TBAA while later, Geralt and Yennefer traveled to the city of Aedd Gynvael in Narok, and during their stay in the city, Geralt took on a contract on a nasty zeugl that had infested the sewers. While fighting the beast, he got stuck in a rubbish heap and was dragged through the filth, and after striking the killing blow, the beast's slime and bile spilled all over the witcher, adding to his stench.In May 1272, Geralt and Vesemir were headed to the village of Willoughby, following the instructions of a recent letter from Yennefer, who they were tracking. They stopped in White Orchard, hearing news that Willoughby had been burnt to the ground. Following a nightmare about Ciri and the Wild Hunt, Geralt rode with Vesemir to a ford, where they encountered the merchant Bram being attacked by a royal griffin, which they drove off. After arriving at the White Orchard inn, they spoke with the innkeep Elsa. Geralt and Vesemir then sat down, before Geralt introduced himself to Gaunter O'Dimm, and then asked about Yennefer, with the merchant stating she had ridden through White Orchard to the Nilfgaardian Garrison.After riding to the garrison, Geralt met Peter Saar Gwynleve, a Nilfgaardian officer. He told Geralt that he would tell the witcher about Yennefer's location if he killed the griffin plaguing White Orchard. After agreeing, the captain pointed two people who could help him with griffin issue, the hunter Mislav and the herbalist Tomira. Geralt needed to visit Tomira, to find out where buckthorn, an aqueous plant that would lure the griffin, grew in the area. She pointed him to the Ismena river, which flowed straight through the center of town. After diving down and obtaining some buckthorn, Geralt headed to Mislav for more information about the griffin, but couldn't find him at his hut, and instead found him hunting in the woods. Mislav asked that the witcher help kill some wild dogs that were attacking villagers, which was an easy job for Geralt, but hard for Mislav, as he found that the dogs had killed his former lord's stable hand. Mislav then took Geralt to the site of where the griffin had attacked some Nilfgaardian soldiers, so Geralt said his thanks and then started to investigate the scene. After following footprints, he came across the creature's nest, in the middle of the Vulpine Woods, with the griffin's female mate lying dead in the nest, killed by Nilfgaardian soldiers, who had provoked the current male griffin to attack.Note: Geralt may have just found the attack sight and buckthorn exploring, without the help of Mislav and Tomira.After preparing for the fight, Geralt returned to the inn and laid the plan out to Vesemir. The two of them set the buckthorn-stuffed sheep in a nearby field, and Vesemir gave Geralt his first ever personal crossbow, before the griffin arrived. The two fought the griffin, even when it flew away to a nearby windmill, until they killed it. Geralt took its head to the garrison, where Peter Saar Gwynleve was whipping the local ealdorman for delivery of rotten grain. After showing the griffin's head, the Nilfgaardian captain told Geralt that Yennefer was in nearby Vizima. Angered at the fact she was less than a day's ride the entire time, Geralt could either accept or decline the coin, before heading back to the inn.Inside the inn with Vesemir, Geralt went to buy provisions for the road, but the atmosphere was very dangerous, with several racists attacking the two witchers after they tried to break up a fight. Killing the men caused Elsa to be disgusted and demand they leave at once, though directly outside the tavern stood Yennefer, with a Nilfgaardian escort, much to Geralt's relief, as he had finally found her. The sorceress explained that Emporer Emhyr var Emreis had summoned Geralt to Vizima, and that he come with her back to the palace. Saying his goodbyes to Vesemir, he rode with them, through to the night when the Wild Hunt attacked the soldiers, Geralt and Yennefer, though the sorceress and witcher were the only to survive thanks to Yennefer's magic.[6]TBAMost of the time, he could be apathetic, cynical, and threatening. Despite his outwardly cold nature, Dandelion noted that behind his exterior was hiding a fiercely loyal friend, and a man of good humour and as someone not indifferent to suffering. Geralt had many good friends all over the Northern Realms, such as Caldemeyn of Blaviken, Zoltan Chivay, and of course Dandelion. He was also very protective of and loyal to his friends and companions, and was willing to go to great lengths for those who mattered to him. He could be kind-hearted and caring to the people he loved.Geralt was also shown to be extremely adept at allaying intense, and at times bleak, situations and as a man who would much sooner have everyone return home than draw their swords. His lifespan made him a world-weary man, often expressing disdain and circuitous insults to those he considered cruel, foolish, etc. He may have risked Temeria's future to save Triss Merigold from the Nilfgaardians. He also was shown requesting Scoia'tael to spare Dandelion and kill only him.Geralt frequently showed remorse and had revelations in his life. Other times he had complete emotional breakdowns, even giving up being a witcher in general and dropping his morals at one point.The story of Geralt and Ciri became a popular saga many years, probably centuries, after the actual events had taken place. The chief sources of these stories were Dandelion's ballads and the bard's autobiography Half a Century of Poetry. However, Dandelion was not fond of telling the whole truth, and ultimately many versions of Geralt's and Ciri's adventures were spread far and wide, including simplified and harmless children's tales, leading scholars to struggle in distinguishing those stories that were considered canon from those that seemed non-canonical and embellished.Many years in the future, the sorceress Nimue verch Wledyr ap Gwyn and her assistant Condwiramurs Tilly conducted extensive research into the matter, in an attempt to determine what had really happened to Geralt and Ciri.After seemingly having been killed by a mob during a pogrom of nonhumans at the end of the Witcher saga, Geralt returns to life with no recollection of the details of his sudden reappearance or of the five intervening years. He is rescued by the last remaining witchers in the world and is taken back to Kaer Morhen. There, he is drawn into a complicated conspiracy concerning the witchers, their secrets, and the nefarious forces that are after that knowledge.Shortly after Geralt's return to Kaer Morhen, an attack is launched on the fortress by an unknown organization, spearheaded by two mages. Though one mage is unknown to her, Triss recognizes the other as Savolla. Geralt provides assistance to his friends in repelling the attack, before Vesemir proclaims that the party must split up as the two mages, having unleashed a frightener in the main courtyard, have descended into the witchers' laboratory to procure the secrets they are in pursuit of. Vesemir offers Geralt the choice of either going after the mages with Triss, or staying to assist the other witchers in defeating the frightener.Later, Leo and Geralt find Triss in an injured state, and descend to the laboratory in order to stop the mages from absconding with the secret formulae. When confronted with the witchers, one of the attackers, namely, The Professor, kills Leo with a crossbow bolt before teleporting away, along with the mages and a sizeable portion of the witchers' writings.During Leo's funeral, Vesemir decides that the attackers, known as Salamandra, must be tracked down and forced to pay for their transgressions. He tells Geralt to use Temeria as a starting point in his search, as he once lifted a curse there from Foltest's daughter.Geralt pursues the mysterious Salamandra, and in the process meets many people from his past, as well as new acquaintances who either require the witcher's help or offer their own in his quest to regain his identity.Vizima is under quarantine due to the Catriona plague, and Geralt cannot enter it as he lacks the necessary letter of safe conduct. Thus, he settles in Vizima's outskirts. During the night, Geralt is attacked by spectral hounds, known as barghests, which were in pursuit of a woman and child. The witcher manages to rescue a boy named Alvin, who levitates and recites Ithlinne's Prophecy in a disturbing voice after the attack, revealing himself to be a Source. Shortly thereafter, Geralt meets Shani, a red-haired medic hailing from Oxenfurt who arrived here to help quell the Catriona epidemic. She decides to place the now-orphaned Alvin under her care. Geralt also meets the alchemist Kalkstein, a trader named Declan Leuvaarden, and Zoltan Chivay, an old friend from Geralt's past life.Geralt seeks out the Reverend, who agrees to assist him in obtaining passage to the city if he fulfils the contract on The Beast, a certain entity which is thought to be responsible for the barghests. The Reverend sends Geralt to assist three pillars of the community: Odo, Mikul, and Haren Brogg.The trader Odo tasks Geralt with weeding out the echinops in his garden after a session of heavy drinking. Mikul sends the witcher to clear the local crypt of ghouls, wherein Geralt discovers the corpse of a poisoned woman. Haren Brogg tasks Geralt with driving away the drowners from his goods by the riverbank. It becomes apparent, however, that Haren is actually a hawker, after a regiment of Scoia'tael attempts to take away the goods Geralt was tasked to protect.The Reverend then offers Geralt to deal with Abigail, a local witch, to whom Shani has now transferred her responsibility over Alvin. The witch carries out a magical procedure in which she attempts to communicate with the spirit of the White Frost in Alvin awakened by the Beast. It confers that the Beast's appearance was caused by the sins of the local residents.Geralt returns to the Inn, wherein he discovers a group of Salamandra fighters assaulting Shani. After dealing with them, the witcher pursues the other members of the Salamandra. Upon reaching their cavernous lair, Geralt discovers Alvin inside who was taken from Abigail's home and turned over to the group by the Reverend and his followers. Further along the cave system, Geralt and Alvin meet Abigail, who asks for the witcher's help in fleeing the enraged crowd that has amassed outside. Geralt makes a choice, either to save Abigail from being lynched, or to leave her to the judgment of the Outskirts' residents. After deciding, he defeats the Beast and the barghests.Later, after receiving a pass into Vizima from the Reverend, or taking it from his corpse, Geralt returns to the Inn, and travels to the city with Shani. However, he is stopped by Mikul at the gates and is turned over to the city guard.The third installment of the trilogy, like its predecessors, follows Geralt through his final adventures. Following the events of Witcher 2, Geralt has regained his memory of the past and prepares to embark on a new journey. In the Witcher 3, Geralt is on the hunt for the only person he considers kin, Ciri. Along his journey, Geralt must face the Wild Hunt in order to protect the people he cares about.In the new open world, Geralt has the opportunity to complete quests that are both part of the main story and side quests. He will also interact with old friends Dandelion and Vesemir along with potential lovers Triss Merigold and Yennefer.Step again into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer. This time travel back to the wilds of Velen and the nooks and alleys of Oxenfurt where he'll try to complete a contract from the mysterious Man of Glass, hired to defeat a ruthless bandit captain and Redanian nobleman, Olgierd von Everec, a man who possesses the power of immortality. Geralt, caught in a thick tangle of deceit, will need all his cunning and strength to solve the mystery and emerge unscathed.As Geralt of Rivia again, travel to a land untainted by war: the Nilfgaardian region of Toussaint, where you will unravel the horrifying secret behind a beast terrorizing the kingdom. With all trails leading to dead ends, only a witcher can solve the mystery and survive the evil lurking in the night as an atmosphere of carefree indulgence and knightly ritual masks an ancient, bloody secret.Geralt is one of the four playable characters in The Witcher: Adventure Game.He is called there ""MONSTER SLAYER - DEADLY IN COMBAT"".[7]Geralt of Rivia was one of playable characters in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins.

For example, the half-elf Schirrú was commonly referred to as a half-elf before his name was even known to others, with a dead giveaway being his eyes: large, almond-shaped, and yellow-green.[1] However, others, like Beatrix of Kovir, were said to display almost none of their elven heritage and even by human standards she was considered ugly.[2]During the quest ""A Ghost Story"", Geralt rescues a half-elf from a gang of thugs who have been holding her against her will in an abandoned house in the slums of the Temple Quarter. Geralt is lured there under false pretences and the group of miscreants try to ambush the witcher when he arrives.As Geralt quickly points out, this was a particularly badly calculated move: trying to ambush a known witcher, of all people!

Responsible for sweeping reforms, he changed the organisation into the Order of the Flaming Rose- the Church of the Eternal Fire's militant arm. He also possessed innate ""source"" powers, though he had no formal training and thus, had little control of them.Jacques later died in 1270 during his attempted rebellion against King Foltest.Before joining the Order, it was rumored that he was a vagrant fueled only by his hatred of non-humans.In 1268, after the death of Grand Master Rudolf Valaris, the mantle passed to Jacques who used his new position to carry out radical reforms that completely changed the structure and goals of the Order. Under his leadership, the order was renamed the Order of the Flaming Rose, and its rules were adopted from the tenets of the faith of the Eternal Fire.[2] This was secretly supported by Sigismund Dijkstra of the Redanian Secret Service, who wanted to create an organization full of fanatics and spread fear against mages to counteract the mages' rising influence on politics in the Northern Kingdoms.[3]Most Temerians, whether they were nobility or peasants, admired the Grand Master because of his charisma, glistening armor, and above all the enormous scale of persecution aimed at elves and dwarves who were, by some, considered enemies of society after the Northern Wars. Remaining commandos of the Scoia'tael became the biggest opponent of the Order, with Jacques using particularly brutal means to defeat them. He also waged secret wars against other clandestine organizations like the Lodge of Sorceresses in order to win as much power over society as possible.[4]In 1270, when King Foltest left the city for a short time, Jacques used his absence to sow seeds of chaos in Vizima and nearby surroundings, increasing hate towards non-humans, secretly supporting the Salamandra gang, and provoking Scoia'tael into all-out war. All of this was designed to try and overthrow Foltest to bring about a new age, and destroy all non-humans, whom he viewed as unworthy relics of the past. Using stolen witchers' secrets, and with the aid of the Salamandra leaders ""Professor"" and Azar Javed, Jacques created mutant soldiers to uphold the increasingly twisted ideals he espoused.When Foltest returned and had a tour through Old Vizima, he was attacked by Scoia'tael and was saved at the last moment by Jacques. The Grand Master then demanded to be given full command of the troops and the city, but Foltest refused. It soon became clear that Jacques would stop at nothing to achieve his goals and released Greater Brothers into the streets. Realizing the Grand Master needed to be dealt with, Folest enlisted the witcher Geralt's help.When Geralt confronted Jacques, the two spoke to each other for a long time with the Grand Master trying to show Geralt his visions and beliefs but he couldn't be swayed and ultimately the two fought in the Ice Plains.If Geralt allows the King of the Wild Hunt to take his soul: standing back, Geralt let the King of the Wild Hunt take the Grand Master's soul, thus killing him.If Geralt denies the King of the Wild Hunt: Geralt denied the King of the Wild Hunt's wish to take Jacques soul and killed the Grand Master himself."

"73","Adalbertus Aloysius Kalkstein","Human","Male","Alchemist Armorer Author"," Alchemists, Geomancers, and Pyromancers Club","Adalbertus Aloysius Kalkstein (died 1272) was a master alchemist, author, occasional armorer and honorary chairman of the Alchemists, Geomancers, and Pyromancers Club. While in Vizima, he owned a house in the nonhuman district of the Temple Quarter, right next door to Golan Vivaldi and just around the corner from Shani.At some point, after a turmoil caused by the Order of the Flaming Rose and Scoia'tael, he moved into Novigrad where he lived his ordinary life until he was captured by witch hunters and subsequently burned at the stake.Adalbertus Aloysius Kalkstein was a Master of Alchemy who, for the most of his life, inhabited a house in the non-human district of Vizima's Temple Quarter, in a neighborhood with dwarven banker Golan Vivaldi. However, at times, he would leave the city and travel to Oxenfurt where he would attend scientific discussions and convents.Kalkstein was the author of many alchemical works, including a treatise called Transmutations and Metamorphoses analyzing attempts to animate inanimate matter, an activity otherwise known as constructing a golem. The alchemist has been interested in this matter for years but due to his convoluted style, his work was difficult to read.Apart from being a very powerful alchemist, Kalkstein also knew a great deal about gnomish technology and elven mastery of crafting armor. To fund his researches and experiments, he ran a shop in his house and sold items related to alchemy such as books and scrolls, Ginatz's acid (15), white vinegar (20), Sulfur (30), Albar's crystals (40), a few talismans, like garlic and red ribbon, barghest skulls, wolf pelts, alp fangs. He also bought White Raffard's Decoction and Wives' Tears if someone offered him.[1]Geralt and Kalkstein first met in the Outskirts where the state of quarantine was making it difficult for anyone to enter the city, and the alchemist was no exception. While Kalkstein waited to have his pass accepted, he bided his time at the local Inn.The witcher immediately recognized that the alchemist was very interested in anything alchemical or unnatural. On his first encounter with the witcher, he asks if he can examine his body for scientific purposes. When Geralt took exception, he then relented and asked if he could perform an autopsy upon his death. This did not really go over well either so they changed the subject and never returned to such discussion.Geralt met Kalkstein a second time at the Merchants' Gate, where he was threatened by Salamandra bandits who intended on taking his equipment, by force. After a quick round of swordplay, thugs were dispatched and a grateful alchemist offered Geralt a reward: his services anytime the witcher is in Vizima, at a discount. It was also at this point in his journey that Geralt realized the full extent of the repercussions of the theft of the Witchers' Secrets from Kaer Morhen and his resolve to track them down and make them pay is renewed.Once Geralt got out of prison and took up his investigation of Salamandra, it did not take long before the name, ""Kalkstein"" cropped up again. Remembering that the alchemist's place of business was in the Temple Quarter, Geralt set to find it. From a shingle outside Kalkstein's house, he learned that the alchemist needed someone handy with a sword for his latest project. This seemed to be the project that excited him most: opening the mysterious Mage's tower in the swamp. Prior to Geralt, he hired Berengar to look into it, but that witcher just disappeared.During the autopsy portion of the investigation into the murder of the crown witness, the alchemist became one of the suspects. If Geralt believed that Kalkstein was involved with the organization, Azar Javed seized the opportunity presented by Geralt's false conclusions and further blackened Kalkstein's reputation with tales of his alleged involvement with the Salamandra. Only after a confrontation with the real culprit at the Mage's tower did Geralt finally learn the truth.[1]Once the tower has been opened, it became Kalkstein's main base of operations for a while. And fortunately for the witcher, there were no hard feelings if Geralt had implicated him earlier. Their relationship merely continued as normal. Of course, if the alchemist was not implicated, there was nothing to forgive, so it was business as usual.Also in the tower, Kalkstein told Geralt about his new ground-breaking theory of invisible particles constituting matter, in constant movement and interacting with each other even though he can not go out with it yet as he does not have any good enough proof.When the fight between the Jacques de Aldersberg's Order of the Flaming Rose and Yaevinn's Scoia'tael erupted, the alchemist moved with his laboratory to Old Vizima, where tales of Mutants and strigas roaming the streets have lured the curious scientist. If Geralt decided to stay neutral throughout the conflict, Kalkstein also became his armorer when it became necessary to fashion Raven's armor for the final battle.[1]After the events which transpired in Vizima, Kalkstein moved to Novigrad where he continued his alchemy workshop, earning his living selling potions and bombs. When Dandelion asked him for a substance strong enough to open Reuven's treasure vault, whose riches he needed to repay Cyprian Wiley, Kalkstein created a magical bomb from phosphorus and wyvern oil that stood up to a task.Unfortunately, however, not long before Geralt's arrival in Novigrad, Kalkstein fell prey to Radovid V's witch hunts. He supposedly went out with a ""bang"". When he died on a pyre, fiery beasts surrounded him and shot into the air to form letters which spelled ""Radovid sucks flaccid cock"".[2]Kalkstein is one of the most prominent characters in The Witcher and is central to many quests:"

In Chapter I he appears in the Outskirts along with the ghost of Leo. In Chapter IV, Geralt must be careful not to summon him while completing a quest for the Hermit. These encounters culminate at the end of the game and true to form, the witcher is faced with another dilemma, as the King has come to claim the soul of Jacques de Aldersberg.During his final conversation with Letho, Geralt recalls his forgotten memories, remembering that Eredin found him and Yennefer at the Isle of Avalon after Ciri rescued the two from the riot that took place in Rivia. The Hunt attacked Geralt and Yennefer soon after, taking the sorceress captive after laying waste to the island.Geralt had began searching for Yennefer, along the way he gathered the witchers of the Viper School and engaged the Wild Hunt in an attempt to rescue her but the Hunt far outnumbered them. So Geralt offered his soul in exchange for Yennefer's, to which Eredin agreed without hesitation.Developer CD Projekt's characterization of the King of the Wild Hunt taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game The Witcher for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:""This powerful being leads a retinue of wraith raiders in their mad rush across the sky. The Wild Hunt, like a comet, is considered an ill omen, a harbinger of disaster and war. The King of the Wild Hunt is an unusual opponent, if only because he is from another world — a fact well known to Sapkowski's fans.""When we decided that the King of the Wild Hunt would appear in the game, we knew he had a serious part to play. From beginning to end, this nightmarish ruler appears on Geralt's path as an oppressor and portent of misery. The King of the Wild Hunt is linked to the forces of Destiny: he hovers just outside the main narrative, only appearing to remind the witcher of painful events or to provoke difficult discussions.Legends and myth about the Wild Hunt have origins in ancient Northern and Central Europe folklore, in our real world. According to myth, the Wild Hunt is a hunt or chase of spirits and other supernatural beings, all completed with hounds, horses and huntsmen.It represents an omen of danger, misfortune or catastrophe, or simply the personification of human fear.

She spends her time in a shallow, lily-pad filled covered inlet on Black Tern Island and can be consulted there on various matters relating to Destiny, her servants, quests for the Holy Grail and the relations between the locals.Even goddesses get lonely. It is tough being the object of adulation and reverence. While most locals will tell you that they love the Lady, they would never dream of actual physical contact with her. In this regard, Geralt has no such qualms and can generously provide companionship of the more mundane kind.To obtain the dialog option to romance her, Geralt must first speak to the Hermit after speaking to her and ask him about the grail. Failing to do so makes the romance option unavailable. To get the romance card, Geralt must first tell the Lady of the Lake that he [has] had ""a revelation and [wishes] to embark on a mission"". This will cause the Lady's hackles to go up and she'll stop him then and there (having only just told him that she takes a dim view of grail quests), but then the witcher says claims it was only ""A jest..."" and they continue their conversation.She gets around to the fact that it is lonely being a goddess and while she is fully aware that her subjects may lust for her, they would never dare act on those feelings. She tells the witcher that he should compliment her, so he does, in a fairly lame manner, which she is quick to point out. Finally he gets an inspiration and decides to compliment her ass, saying it puts others to shame. This amuses her greatly and they finally get to know each other better.If he persists with the quest ""of paramount importance"" conversation, and it does initially sound noble, the Lady knights him ""Sir Bonehead"" and dismisses him from her sight, none too fondly. Geralt can then still speak with her, he can even backtrack on the grail quest, but no sex. And she tells him so, saying ""you know not how much you have lost"".These are her more active servants, not mere worshipers, the Fisher King and the Hermit. It is the Hermit's duty to the Lady to guard over the kurgen of the knights who died defending her honor.Giving Geralt Aerondight... againGeralt can meet her again in the second expansion for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, during There Can Be Only One secondary quest. After he fulfills five chivalric virtues and defeats the Hermit in a fight, she gives him Aerondight and tells him that she hopes that this time the witcher won't lose it again.Also during early conversations with first Guillaume de Launfal and then Anna Henrietta it is said that Lady of the Lake gave true chivalry to Toussaint and it was also she who cursed sir Luis Alberni, once proud nobleman who violated his vows, into becoming the giant named Golyat.Virtually every knight errant in the duchy is a servant of Duke and Lady but the one and only being truly bound to her by duty is a certain Hermit at Lac Célavy who is guarding the five chivalric virtues. There is also the Fisher King but he is just collecting herbs and transporting worthy folks on islet with his boat."

Known for his biting tongue, he was often rude in conversation. He was particularly rude towards Triss Merigold, addressing her only by her last name, which irritated the sorceress greatly. He does not have much use for politics, a trait common to most witchers due to their code of neutrality. He helped train Ciri in the art of combat. He was described as being at the same age as Coën. He is one of the last witchers to be trained within the walls of Kaer Morhen.Lambert appears in the main campaign of The Witcher, as well as The Price of Neutrality premium module. Despite not being fond of her, when Triss was sick and wounded after a fight with a wizard, Lambert cared for her helping to nurse her back to health. Vesemir suggests this might be because he feels guilty.In The Witcher, he is wandering around the ground floor of Kaer Morhen or busy in the courtyard for the duration of the Prologue.In ""The Price of Neutrality"", he can be found staking out the ford nearest the camp, keeping the local weed problem in check and making sure the unexpected guests do not suddenly try to enter the keep.Lambert is back in the third installment of The Witcher Series and seems to have a deep seated jealousy towards Geralt, as Geralt is an extremely famous and beloved witcher, while Lambert considers his witcher status a cruel twist of fate, and is stuck hunting relatively benign monsters for people who hate witchers.Like some of his fellow monster slayers, he dislikes the lack of choice he had in becoming a witcher; when he was a child, his father continually beat him and his mother until one day his father stumbled onto a Nekker's nest where a witcher saved his life. The witcher then invoked the law of surprise, demanding the first thing the father would see, yet not expect when returning home. Since that day, Lambert despises his lot in life but walks the path nonetheless, for he knows nothing else.Geralt had a dream in the May of 1272, in which he practised training at Kaer Morhen. When he and Ciri walked down to the lower courtyard, they trained with Eskel and Lambert, or more specificially Lambert trained with Eskel, Vesemir with Geralt and Ciri with a training dummy.Eskel and Lambert at Kaer Morhen keepDuring Geralt's travels looking for Ciri, he could encounter Lambert after taking a ekimmara contract. After they had slain the ekimmara, they got to chatting, and Geralt helped track down three members of Jad Karadin's band, Vienne, Lund and Hammond. After they hunted the three down, they hunted down Jad, and confronted him. Geralt could choose to help Lambert kill him or he could stay out of it.After Geralt arrived back to Kaer Morhen, after investigating all leads on Ciri, with Uma, he went with Lambert to the Circle of Elements to repair the phylactery. On the way they encountered several problems, such as trolls and foglets. Lambert later participated in The Battle of Kaer Morhen.If Geralt got to Lambert in time to save him from the Wild Hunt: Geralt and Lambert fought the Wild Hunt side-by-side, and both survived the battle. Lambert later got into a relationship with the sorceress known as Keira Metz.If Geralt didn't get to Lambert in time: Geralt didn't arrive in time to save Lambert and so he died to the Wild Hunt. After the battle was finished they had a funeral in his honor."

After the Battle of Brenna, in which he avenged one of his mates Caleb Stratton, Bruys planned to do business in Novigrad. Eventually, he ended up a bouncer in Vizima.A dwarf born in Mahakam, Bruys joined Chivay's band.[2] For several days, bard Jezkier traveled and sung by their side. During one such day, their camp had been approached by Brendan. Bruys grew warry but Chivay calmed him, introducing Brendan as an old friend.[3]Once, the group waylaid and robbed a rich hawker who tried to flee Dillingen after townfolk exposed his trade with Scoia'tael. The merchant defended his property like a lion, shouting for aid a few times until the dwarves got him with batons. Intending to fund future enterprises of each individual with the treasure, Bruys helped load the trunks on a wagon.In late summer 1267, Bruys and the rest had been escorting Kernow refugees, mothers and children, to safety. They met Geralt of Rivia and the witcher's own group for the first time on a way toward the Yaruga river from Brokilon. Chivay advised Geralt to join up with dwarves on a way eastward. When the large group became short on provisions, Bruys and Yazon Varda vanished into the dark, only to return at dawn with two full sacks, one with horse grub and the second with jerkies, cheese, huge haggis and more refreshment. Another time, he and Figgis Merluzzo went mushroom picking. Later on, Percival Schuttenbach sensed porridge with his infallible gnomish nose and stated people had to live nearby. Chivay decided he, Schuttenbach and Geralt's companions would investigate, while Bruys and Merluzzo awaited for a signal in a form of a sparrowhawk call. Bruys anxiously asked Chivay when he learned bird sounds. Chivay answered the point was if Bruys heard an unrecognizable sound, he would know it's them.After crossing Brugge, the group stopped at O. Convinced not to carry the treasure any longer, Zoltan ordered Bruys, Varda, Merluzzo and Caleb Stratton to hide it. The rest continued to Fen Carn. Much later, during an unexpected battle between the refugees-killing Nilfgaardian Army and the Temerian Army, Chivay's company reunited. They evaded death by running to the woods, but Stratton was hit by the 7th Daerlanian Cavalry Brigade. After burying Stratton and mourning his passing, the dwarves continued. They met Geralt and his company once more, in Angren, and Bruys gave each member a strong handshake. At long last, the company decided to return home to Mount Carbon.[2]Bruys fighting at Brenna.As the end of the Second Northern War had drawn near, Bruys and Merluzzo were part of officer Zoltan Chivay's unit of the Mahakam Volunteer Army. In spring 1268, most regiments sent by Elder of Mahakam Brouver Hoog suffered great losses and were withdrawn to Vizima. With time to recover, most dwarves enjoyed beer and fist-fighting at The Shaggy Bear tavern.To stop the advancing enemy, Temeria mustered its forces and prepared for the Battle of Brenna. Thousands of dogged dwarven volunteers commanded by Colonel Barclay Els stood the right-wing. Alongside the eight light cavalry companies and infamous Adieu's Free Company, unwavering in the face of Ard Feainn Division riders.When Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn tried to run from the battlefield, half-buried in mud pleading for mercy, Chivay showed him to Bruys. Mistaking the Field Marshal for a Daerlanian cavalryman due to a silver scorpion sigil, Bruys swung his weapon up. Thus, they avenged Stratton by unknowingly killing the Nilfgaardian commanding officer.Bruys always dreamed of building steam and water-powered hammerworks. Following the Peace of Cintra, he agreed to start one in Novigrad with Merluzzo and Chivay.[4] However, the mutual venture flopped.[5] Bruys returned to Vizima, moving there for good as he landed a bouncer position at The Shaggy Bear. A self-titled professional dice player, Bruys earned bonus orens gambling.In 1270, Bruys kept in touch with Zoltan Chivay who told him witcher Geralt, thought dead since pogrom in Rivia, lived. Initially refusing to believe, the dwarf welcomed Geralt with open arms when the witcher entered the tavern in Temple Quarter. When asked, Bruys praised his job as peaceful and reminded Geralt of past adventures.[1]"

Alongside Geralt, the four Viper witchers fought against the Wild Hunt, until Geralt exchanged himself for Yennefer. Out of respect for their departed comrade, the Vipers took care of Yennefer, who, suffering from amnesia, began to cause trouble for the group. Eventually, all of them were captured by the Nilfgaardian secret service. In custody, they were approached by Imperator Emhyr var Emreis, who offered to rebuild their school if they sowed chaos in for him in the Northern Kingdoms by killing its kings.[2]Critical momentIn September 1270, he managed to enter the Temerian Royal Palace in Vizima just when Geralt, who lost his memory shortly after their last meeting, was in the process of receiving his reward for destroying Salamandra and killing the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, Jacques de Aldersberg.The renegade witcher snuck past all the guards, killing two of them in the process and almost killed King Foltest. Before anything else could happen, Geralt rushed to the king's aid; a hard-fought battle broke out in which the dual-wielding assassin got the upper hand, so Geralt threw his recently-acquired coin pouch at his former comrade to stun him, before cutting off his arm and killing him with a slash across the back.

She was one of the few sorceresses able to polymorph, and was thought to be ""no less than three hundred years old"" by 1267.[1]She led the Thanedd coup against the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, intending to neutralize suspected traitors allied with Nilfgaard. Later, she helped found the Lodge of Sorceresses and is considered its leader.She was one of the victims of the Witch Hunts, having been tortured and killed by Archpriest Willemer's men. Many years later, she was exonerated and canonized as Martyr Saint.Even though Geralt never met this sorceress face to face, her name appears in conversation then and again. It is also speculated that either she or Keira Metz was speaking with Triss Merigold through the latter's magic mirror at the very beginning of Chapter III.Philippa Eilhart maintained quarters in the dwarven town of Vergen, which she used to share with her ""lover"" and apprentice, a ""leashed sorceress"", Cynthia, as well as a house in Loc Muinne.

The feathers on this doll immediately reminded Geralt of Philippa, but there was no definitive proof that the doll in fact represented her.She contacted Margarita Laux-Antille, explaining her plan to regrow her eyes by cultivating tissues on precious stones, just as Vilgefortz did, and to revive the Lodge. Then she went to Novigrad to seek help from her former lover, the sorcerer Arthur de Vleester. Having humiliated him in the past, de Vleester convinced her she'd be safer in her owl form, and then attached a dimeritium band around her ankle. Following de Vleester's execution during the witch hunts, Philippa fell into the possession of Zoltan Chivay, who affectionately named her Poppy.He later lost her to Sigismund Dijkstra, who made the mistake of removing her dimeritium band, and she returned to human form and attacked. Only Geralt's intervention put an end to her rampage. Philippa was then recruited to help stop the Wild Hunt in exchange for amnesty from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. After Margarita was rescued from Oxenfurt, she and Philippa met with Ciri to offer her equal partnership in the Lodge, to which she declined.Philippa later assisted Geralt in seeking out the Sunstone to help in their plan to lure out the Wild Hunt. While searching through the Skellige caves, Philippa criticised Geralt for having an overprotective attitude towards Ciri, stating that the Lodge were not a pack of wolves he could scare away with his sword, to which the witcher insisted that he could because they were. Once they found the Sunstone, Geralt assumed that she would take the artifact for herself, but Philippa insisted that that was not the case.

"115","Radovid V","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Radovid V the Stern (Polish: Radowid V Srogi) was the king of Redania from the Redanian Dynasty in the last quarter of the 13th century. His reign became, along with witch hunts, one of the defining factors of the post-war period that followed the Peace of Cintra. Radovid was a polarizing figure: a brilliant strategist and a superb general by some, a paranoid madman by others. There were also many who took the middle view of his policies being harsh but justified.He inherited his titles and estates as the only son of King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore. His two older sisters were Dalimira and Milena. Even though his father died in 1267, Prince Radovid didn't succeed him immediately because he was only twelve at the time and for several years the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council under influential Duke Nitert and Count Sigismund Dijkstra, the then-spymaster of Redanian Secret Service.Radovid bore a deep aversion towards mages that stemmed from his father being secretly assassinated by an unknown elf at the behest of the sorceress advisor Philippa Eilhart,[N 3] who then pulled strings from behind his back, ruled in his name and dominated and demeaned him throughout his youth.Radovid was born in 1255 in Tretogor to the royal pair, King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore, as their third child. He grew up with two older sisters: Dalimira, informally known as Dalka, and Milena, who was known as Milka in a similar fashion. Dalka eventually dedicated her life to the priesthood after her failed engagement with King Foltest of Temeria, who instead chose to marry his own sister Adda, while Milka attended Aretuza to become a sorceress Millegarda.[2]When Prince Radovid was 9 years old he was formally engaged to Cirilla, Princess of Cintra, when she was 12. The engagement was formalized between his father and Queen Calanthe, Ciri's grandmother, but the king broke the engagement off after half a year without giving any explanation and Ciri and Radovid never even had a chance to talk to each other.[3]On the day of the outbreak of the Second Northern War with the Nilfgaardian Empire, his father had unexpectedly fallen victim to an elven assassin.[4] A fact unknown to practically anyone was that it was Philippa Eilhart, at the time fighting on Thanedd Island, who hired the elf in order to gain more direct rule. Redania fell into chaos, as usually happens in such circumstances, and Queen Hedwig was not in a state to control things.[N 3] The aristocracy started to organize itself into factions, attempting to tear some land out for each and every one of them. Several practically licked the boots of Nilfgaardian emissaries led by Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen and were ready to rule with Nilfgaardian blessing, only to be caught off guard and stopped by the famous Redanian Secret Service. There remained but a handful of those who were spared, those with important enough social status and armed might to maintain peace, like Duke Nitert.[4]Nitert was put in charge of the Regency Council appointed to save the realm from a total civil war and they managed to do so, by hanging everyone they deemed traitor in specially modified fortifications with internment camps - most infamous of which would be Drakenborg. Its members, however, overlooked their underage crown prince and none of the Northern Kingdoms' elites, not even Philippa who took it upon herself to raise him, expected him to grow into a firm monarch who would repay all humiliations he and his mother had suffered during the interregnum.A young but decisive, unrelenting King Radovid V's deed quickly earned him the epithet of ""the Stern"".[5]He began his reign by taking care of various nobles who ruled on their lands rather independently from Tretogor. He proved a capable political actor, manipulating events to the advantage of both his own position and Redania's. He utilized Redania's famed spy network to foster links with multiple potential allies, picking and choosing as he saw fit while ensuring those discarded were destroyed. In all his political actions, he attempted to embody the idea that a king should be ruthless towards his foes and generous to his friends.[6]King Radovid meeting Geralt for the first timeLooking to secure relations with Temeria, Radovid made his way to the kingdom's capital of Vizima in 1270. However, while there he eventually came into contact with Salamandra through some ""mutual acquaintances"" and thought he could make use of the criminal organization but ultimately concluded not to do so. Despite this, the witcher Geralt of Rivia happened across some of the criminals communicating via a mirror with the king, who only revealed he wasn't backing the group before closing off communications with the witcher.[7]Eventually, though, his hideout was discovered by the witcher. The two conversed for a bit, with Radovid revealing why he was in Vizima before asking the witcher's opinion on Adda the White, who he was seeing as a possible way to combine the two royal families. The two then parted ways.Back from Temeria, Radovid V began to gather his armies and erect fortresses. To counter the sorceresses' rising power, he invited the Order of the Flaming Rose to Redania and granted them lands.[8] He made several military reforms, espousing the idea that a soldier was only as good as their breastplate. He ensured that his armies were well-equipped, allowing his quartermasters as much gold as was needed to keep his infantry in solid armor. Aware that human soldiers were neither as strong as dwarves nor as dexterous as elves, identified their key advantage: their numbers. A mass of humans, led by a capable of commander, could overwhelm an individually superior force. His final military philosophy concerned the effectiveness of heavy cavalry, and he would suggest that any battlefield problem could be overcome by a gallant charge. These tactics would see him through several successful military campaigns, culminating in a subjugating nearly the entirety of the Northern Kingdoms and the defeat of the invading Nilfgaardian forces of Emhyr var Emreis' third invasion.[6]In July 1271, Radovid came to the deliberations at Loc Muinne, followed by a number of regular soldiers and knights of the Flaming Rose who were meant to ensure that peace talks remained peaceful, as well as step in if things did not go Redania's way. Shortly after arriving, the King imprisoned Phillipa Eilhart with the help of Nilfgaardian delegation. To avenge his father, he had her eyes gouged out and meant to execute her before she escaped.[8]When the Third Northern War broke out, Radovid remained the only monarch to have the strength to resist Nilfgaard. Taking advantage of this, during the winter break, he invaded a weakened Kaedwen and absorbed the Kaedwenian Army into his own. He also had Temerian partisans[9] and Kovirian mercenary companies at his disposal,[10] and considered utilizing the Crescent Moon, an influential independence movement in the Nilfgaard-conquered Nazair.[11]However, both Radovid and Emhyr had set their eyes on Novigrad, as whoever controlled the free city would not only have control over the ports, but its hefty treasury as well, therefore making victory likely for the one who gained control of it. To try and weaken the city for his taking, Radovid employed the services of Whoreson Junior, one of the ""Big Four"" of Novigrad's underground crime bosses, enticing him with money and a grand estate in Oxenfurt in return for turning on the other bosses and bringing about their downfall.His plan worked to a degree, but once it was clear that Junior had outlived his usefulness, Radovid decided to reveal his location to Geralt - who sought revenge on Whoreson Junior for unrelated reasons. However, Radovid took advantage of this and called upon Geralt for a favour; while onboard his flagship, the HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor, Radovid asked the witcher for his help in finding and apprehending Philippa Eilhart.

With this victory, Radovid absorbed all of the North - including Novigrad - into his own empire, resulting in him being known as the ""Protector of the North"".[9][6]Perhaps the most defining feature of Radovid's reign was his policy of relentless witch hunts. All over the North, groups such as mages, non-humans, herbalists and soothsayers were burned at the stake in mass numbers. Radovid seemingly lived up to an elderly age[6] and was remembered in the history as Radovid the Stern.[5] Many listed him alongside Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart as one of the key people responsible for the witch hunts.[12]  	 		 		 		 			Philippa stabbing Radovid 		 	Philippa stabbing RadovidSometime later on, while his ship was anchored in Novigrad, Radovid was approached by many others claiming to know where Philippa was, but seeing through these lies, he dealt brutal punishments to the deceivers, from having them blinded, their tongues and fingers cut off, or drowned. Geralt subsequently approached him, claiming to have found her location: St. Gregory's Bridge. After being provided proof in the form of Vizimir's ring, which Philippa had used to pass decrees in the late king's name, Radovid and his soldiers set off for the bridge at once.However, the king turned on the witcher, claiming that he irritated him, and ordered his men to kill him. The witcher was ultimately saved by the timely arrival of Temerian guerrillas, who ambushed the area and thusly caused Radovid to flee. At the last house, the monarch banged on the door to open up, but was stunned when Philippa opened the door to greet him; the sorceress then proceeded to blow powder in Radovid's face, blinding him and leaving him in agonizing pain, before she thrusted a dagger in his back, killing the king.[9]A beverage known as Redanian Herbal was called ""stern"" in honor of Radovid.[7]Radovid's Journal image"

His preferred base of operations is in the back room of The Hairy Bear. He also seems to have some sort of arrangement in place with the innkeeper, but the nature of the agreement is murky at best.The second place is his home where he is usually accompanied by Coleman, who is part of his little criminal organization. However he is rarely home, leaving it to be guarded by two of his henchmen.He seems to have an inexhaustible supply of minions, and he is apparently not too bothered by their frequent turnover due to shortened lifespans.

Geralt recommends him to use a more memorable nickname in place of his real name, apparently resulting in him adopting the alias Ramsmeat, though he tells our witcher to shove off and doesn't seem to recognize him in the main game."
"118","Rayla","Half-elf (games)","Female","Mercenary Rank(s) Officer"," Aedirnian Special Forces (formerly)Order of the Flaming Rose (games)","Rayla of Lyria,[1] known first as Black Rayla[2] and later as White Rayla,[3] was a natural-born soldier and a veteran of the wars with Nilfgaard. She was a mercenary and later an officer of the special forces of King Demavend of Aedirn. While she was guarding the withdrawal of civilians from invaded Aedirn, her unit was wiped out by Scoia'tael commandos.[2] She survived the capture, albeit maimed and disfigured.[3]She early became a mercenary and departed for adventures. At some point in her life she met Geralt of Rivia, witnessed his fighting skills, and became impressed by them. She also visited Vengerberg a few times, meeting the sorceress Yennefer.She fought for Nordlings during the First Northern War. Later, she participated in a gathering at Bleobheris, during which she watched Dandelion's performance and discussed with other spectators the events described in his ballad.[1]Some time later, Rayla joined the special forces formed by King Demavend. In June 1267, she was tasked with escorting Archmistress Tissaia de Vries to Gors Velen. There, Yennefer argued that Rayla, as a mercenary fighting for money, would not be able to make sacrifices like soldiers who defend their own country and homes, while Margarita Laux-Antille defended the warrioress. Yennefer's predictions would later prove untrue.Alas, the Nilfgaardian invasion proceeded without obstacle and what remained of Rosberg was burned ruins. One of the few survivors, Xavier Lemmens, informed Queen Meve and Rayla that King Demavend left Rosberg before the siege and was now preparing his defense at Aldersberg.At Aldersberg, the unit finally met King Demavend; Nilfgaardian troops commanded by Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn, however, had already started besieging the city.[4]In the end Lyrians and Aedirnians joined forces and clashed against the Nilfgaardians in what would be later known as the First Battle of Aldersberg. Although Meve and Demavend's troops were defeated and Aldersberg was burned down, the two monarchs managed to save both their lives and those of the citizens of Aldersberg.[2]Following the battle, Demavend fled to Redania. Before leaving Meve, however, he handed her the Leaden Ring, a token which would've given her permission to enter the enclave of Mahakam and ask for military help from Brouver Hoog, the Elder-in-Chief. The King of Aedirn also tasked Rayla with escorting the Queen to her destination.In Mahakam, Rayla was forced to leave Meve because she had to return in Aedirn, since Nilfgaardian troops were now heading towards Demavend's capital, Vengerberg.[4][N 1]Rayla surrounded by Scoia'taelAfter the Battle of Vengerberg was won by Nilfgaard, Rayla's unit protected the civilians fleeing through the Pontar Valley to Temeria. When the Aedirnian army's rearguard was obliterated by Scoia'tael, she ordered her men to stay and become the rearguard themselves, despite their reluctance. She was the last to stand after a fierce battle, surrounded by Scoia'tael. They asked her to drop her weapon, but she replied her sword was too expensive to drop and if they wished to take it, they should break her fingers to do so.[2]Rayla appears again in 1268 – not with broken fingers but missing her whole hand, replaced by a steel hook. While she survived, she apparently suffered much; even her hair turned white. Calling herself ""White Rayla"", she was full of rage and hatred towards the Scoia'tael. After the Battle of Brenna she pursued Toruviel's commandos.[3]Five years after the Battle of Brenna, Rayla continued her hunt for the remaining Scoia'tael while acting as a mercenary for the Order of the Flaming Rose. Leading a unit of Knights of the Order, Rayla arrived in Murky Waters, a small town near Vizima, after hearing of the presence of Toruviel's commandos. After the elves took the villagers hostage, Rayla entrusted the witcher Geralt to tell the elves that she promised a fair trail if they freed the hostages. However, Rayla was then stripped of her command of the unit by an Order adjuntant, citing a letter from Siegfried, in order to take the elves head-on.During the conflict in Old Vizima, Rayla, still working for the Order of the Flaming Rose, was shot twice in the chest by Yaevinn's arrows, leaving her in a near-death state. Later on, she was found and taken by the Salamandra in order to subject her to their mutation process. She thus survived her wounds at the cost of losing most of her mental faculties. She was then used to attack Geralt, who finally put an end to her life.Rayla is a character in Thronebreaker. She can be recruited by Meve as a companion at the start of the quest Ashes of Aedirn.Rayla in gameDepending on the path Geralt chose, White Rayla was one of three possible, but mutually exclusive, sexual partners Geralt can have in Chapter V. He will sleep with her if he chooses the Order path."
"119","Raymond Maarloeve","Human","Male","Private investigator"," Codringher and Fenn (formerly)","Raymond Maarloeve was a private investigator who ran a business in the house closest to the main entrance to the sewers, Vizima's Temple Quarter. During his early years, he trained under Codringher and Fenn from Dorian, until setting up his own detective firm in Temeria's capital. When the Order of the Flaming Rose basically took over the district he lived in, he became a friend with one of its knights, Siegfried of Denesle, who later on mentioned Maarloeve to witcher Geralt when the former was looking to take down Salamandra and Azar Javed.He even had a book written about him called ""Raymond Maarloeve - A Biography Enhanced"".Raymond Maarloeve was trained in ways of investigative techniques by lawyers Codringher and Fenn, famous for running successful Codringher and Fenn agency in Dorian, and work for them for some time until he started an office of his own.At some point in his life, he found himself a wife and together they had a son. At one night, a grisly home invasion happened in which his wife and dog were brutally murdered, and son abducted, by Salamandra. When he returned home, he discovered his wife pinned to the kitchen door with a spear, his dog shot with a crossbow, and his son nowhere to be found. As a professional, he quickly managed to learn who was behind it, but no their whereabouts.He ran to the City Guard but, with no witnesses and no evidence to go on, the then Captain of the Guard, Vincent Meis, was forced to close the case, which did not again resurface until six months later when a bizarre monstrosity turned up in a trash heap. Raymond was able to discern that the creature was actually his own son due to a unique feature the boy had; a sixth toe, which the monster in the trash also displayed. He has since devoted the rest of his life to find their murderers.Geralt of Rivia first heard of Raymond as simply a private detective friend of Siegfried's. As Geralt and Siegfried were leaving the sewers, having just killed the cockatrice, they were set upon by Salamandra. After a quick skirmish, Siegfried mentioned that Geralt should go see a friend of his, a detective, who conveniently happens to live in the house closest to the main entrance to the sewers.Maarloeve decided to work with Geralt to uncover the Salamandra criminal organization's location and intentions as they have had something in common, a hatred of Salamandra spawned from having lost loved ones (in Geralt's case, the young Witcher in training Leo). When Geralt told Raymond that he's specifically looking for Azar Javed, because ""his boot is due a rendezvous with his ass"", Raymond revealed that he's been investigating Salamandra for some time.A time after the witcher and detective combined their forces to track down Salamandra, Raymond was murdered by Azar Javed and his identity assumed using illusion. His help prior to his untimely demise, however, did prove nonetheless valuable in uncovering some of Salamandra's operations in Vizima. After he died a dwarven dentist, Zahin Schmartz, moved into his house.One of the clues to the fact that ""Raymond"" was no longer the ""real"" Raymond was that Geralt's medallion vibrated wildly whenever he approached Javed disguised as Raymond. Additionally, a box of fisstech could be seen to have been left lying on the downstairs table at the Detective's house. Upon noticing it, Geralt remarked: ""A small box containing fisstech. Must be evidence of some sort. I'd never suspect Raymond of being a user."" It is likely that Javed switched places with Raymond after he went into hiding after Geralt saved him from several Salamanders. Indeed, Geralt's medallion had not vibrated during the brief time it took for Raymond to walk out of the house after the fight was over.Raymond was mentioned one last time at the end of Geralt's journey when the King of the Wild Hunt blamed Geralt for Raymond's death, implying that he thought that if the Witcher were to never have asked for Raymond's help, Azar Javed would have never killed him.[1]At some point prior to 1272, a book was written and published about him under the title ""Raymond Maarloeve - A Biography Enhanced"" with one copy being owned by Skellige's Hierophant Mousesack as discovered by Yennefer when she and Geralt searched his laboratory for Mask of Uroboros.[2]Speaking with Raymond provides some journal entries in addition to his own."

Before the attack itself, Savolla had a sort of argument with the Professor, Sallamandra's other leader who was afraid there would be no witcher left for him to fight after Savolla led the principal charge.In May 1270, Savolla accompanied his master Azar Javed and the Professor during the attack on Kaer Morhen. Like other Salamandra mages, he preferred to let the non-magical ranks deal with the actual crossing of swords while he hanged back using magic to summon all sorts of extra foes and effects. Savolla was more powerful than many of his brethren, enough to control a frightener. Even that, however, did not save him from his death at the hands of either Geralt of Rivia or Triss Merigold.[1]Years later, the hole in the walls of Kaer Morhen left by the Salamandra attack became known as the ""Savolla's breach"", remaining in place as the Wolf witchers had no time to repair it.

She participated in the Battle of Brenna as part of the staff of Milo ""Rusty"" Vanderbeck's field hospital and, many years later, she became the Dean of the Department of Medicine of her alma mater.She died in 1340, 72 years after the Battle of Brenna, at 90 years old.[3]In 1267, Shani was a 17 year old, third year medical student attending Oxenfurt Academy. It's unclear how she and Dandelion met, but the two were friendly enough that when the bard came by to visit that year, he called her over from where she was sitting and the two pretended to flirt as Dandelion was being followed by some of Sigismund Dijkstra's spies. He then asked her to go and deliver a message to the witcher Geralt, who was hiding in Oxenfurt in his hunt to find the mage, Rience, and the two split off.While she successfully found and delivered the message, she and Geralt also proceeded to engage in sex before being interrupted by Dandelion and then Philippa Eilhart. As the group discussed the reason Geralt was in the city, the conversation turned to Rience and Shani spoke up, asking if he had a really bad burn mark on one side of his face. With everyone looking at her in wonderment, Shani explained that tuition was too costly for her stepfather to cover all of it so she'd been stealing supplies from the school and selling on the side to a local named Myhrman. One day when conducting such business, Myhrman had been entertaining a guest he called ""Master Rience"" with a burn mark on his face and who'd made unwanted advances at Shani before Myhrman told him to cut it out as he still wanted to do business with the medical student. With this new information, the group asked Shani to take them to the local, who was now Geralt's best lead in finding Rience.That same night, Shani led them to Myhrman's home: a small tower out in the waters that was only accessible with a draw bridge that Myhrman controlled. However, Shani convinced Myhrman to lower it and the group entered before Geralt and Philippa began to interrogate him on what he knew of Rience. Shortly after, Geralt was able to send a message to the mage and the two met out on the streets, though Rience had brought several hired killers. After the mage ran, letting the Michelet brothers fight Geralt, the witcher quickly cut all four of them down. Shani, who'd been standing on the bridge with Dandelion, saw the men fall and screamed out, attempting to rush over and save them, but Dandelion held onto her due to the dangerous situation. However, Geralt had been badly wounded and while he almost succeeded in killing Rience, Philippa cast a paralyzing spell on the witcher, letting Rience escape. With Geralt suffering from a great loss of blood, Philippa asked Shani, who'd now joined them, to be ready to help as the witcher was going to pass out soon and would need to be patched up quickly.[4]The following year, in March 1268, the Battle of Brenna took place and she worked in one of the field hospitals under Milo ""Rusty"" Vanderbeck. Despite Rusty believing Shani was too young and would soon keel over from either exhaustion or from the gruesome operations, she proved she was quite capable of helping out. Even if she wasn't fully trained in other areas, like sewing up a patient, Rusty simply told her to sew ""red to red, yellow to yellow, white to white"" which eventually became a famous joke of hers many years later as the dean of the Department of Medicine at Oxenfurt Academy.[3]After she left Vizima in 1270, she returned to Oxenfurt to finish her doctorate before opening her own practice within the city. However, as the city was part of Redania, this also meant she had to be ready when called upon by Redania's Army with various urgent matters.[5] By 1272, she was doing well for herself when she was ordered to assist with finding a cure for those being poisoned by something in the city's waters. This eventually led to her entering the sewers with a full army unit to try and find the unknown monster within, while she went to get fresh samples to make an antidote. However, they were attacked by the monster and Shani barely escaped with her life thanks to several of the men's sacrifices to get her to safety.As she fruitlessly tried to save one of them, Geralt, having been sent on a separate contract to kill the monster, ran into her here and together they explored the sewers to try and find the monster's lair, as that was where Shani would likely find a clean sample. After they found it, Geralt then sent her to hide, with strict orders to run if the monster appeared. Following the witcher's instruction, she did run back home, thankfully not being spotted by Ofiri soldiers who'd also entered the sewers to try and rescue their cursed prince.Back in her clinic, she successfully created an antidote to heal those sickened by the toad's poison before Geralt approached her once more, this time requesting help in learning the location of the Von Everec family crypt. As it was a place known for beautiful architecture during its prime, and as the witcher needed a censer only she could acquire from the academy, she invited herself along to see the crypt. However, to complete his task, this meant Olgierd's dead brother's ghost, Vlodimir, took temporary possession of Geralt. As Shani needed a date to a friend's wedding, she offered Vlodimir/Geralt to accompany her and he heartily agreed, not holding back on flirting with her.With Vlodimir/Geralt by her side, the two had a good time at the wedding. However, she had to go think things over about where she and Geralt stood and concluded to just remain friends, as she needed someone who'd be home at the end of everyday. Geralt then requested if she could look into Olgierd some more to learn exactly who he was. While she didn't find anything in the books, she did learn of a Professor Premethine Shakeslock who had known Olgierd.Shortly after, she packed up her clinic and left for the eastern front in Kaedwen, as the Redanian Army had called on her to help tend to their wounded there.In The Witcher, Geralt meets Shani in the Outskirts of Vizima, trying to get into the city in order to help treat victims of the Catriona at St. Lebioda's Hospital. She is surprised to see him, because, as she tells him, ""I heard you died"". While in the Outskirts, Shani stays at the Inn, healing Geralt whenever he enters, and looking after Alvin until Abigail takes him under her wing.Once in Vizima, Shani can be found in St. Lebioda's Hospital during the day (roughly from 9:00 to 18:30), and in the streets or at home during the evening, night and early morning. If Geralt visits her at the hospital, Shani will heal him.She lives near the statue of the aesculapian snake off the merchant's area in the Temple Quarter of Vizima. Her apartment upstairs can be difficult to get to because of Grandma who stands vigil downstairs. It seems that Grandma has lived a full life but now, in retirement, she prefers to play sentry.To get past Grandma, Geralt can use sweet talk, gifts (alcohol or a pair of gold gloves), some orens, or a particular ring. Sometimes this will gain him entry only that one time, other times permanent entry is gained.Old Friend of Mine takes place almost completely in Shani's house. Over the course of the evening, we learn that years ago, Dandelion interrupted something between Shani and Geralt. After the party ends, and Geralt's thank-you or apology, Shani reveals just what it was that the bard had so rudely interrupted. If you give her a red rose, sex will ensue.The medic is also an invaluable resource during the witcher's investigation in Vizima. As the only medical professional, she is the only one who can conduct an autopsy. Luckily for Geralt, she is a friend.In Chapter III, Geralt is forced to choose a guardian for Alvin, his only options being Shani and Triss Merigold. If he chooses Shani, he gets a second chance to know her better.

"129","Siegfried of Denesle","Human","Male","Knight"," Order of the Flaming Rose","Siegfried of Denesle was the 2nd Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, serving from September 1270 to 1272.[2]As a young knight, Siegfried joined the brotherhood to fight against monsters and generally anything evil that might endanger the common folk. Since he was also a nobleman of some moral code and kind heart, Siegfried got along rather well with the witcher Geralt of Rivia and their friendship changed his life forever.Siegfried was born sometime in the 1250s to pious Sir Eyck of Denesle and his wife Sophia.[1] His parents raised him at Castle Denesle, teaching him knightly code of honor.At one point, a serious illness struck Siegfried's mother. He immediately ran to his father and implored him to earn coin for her betterment by demanding payment for next few beasts he would slay. Eyck, however, refused so as to not stain his reputation. This angered Siegfried so much that he renounced his father.[1]Later, when he joined the Order, a rumor began to circulate in the Trade Quarter of Vizima claiming he was secretly a bastard of Jacques de Aldersberg.[3]Siegfried first met Geralt in the Vizima sewers while they were both on the hunt for a dangerous cockatrice. The knight suggested that they join forces to defeat the beast and deal with drowners. After the cockatrice was slain, both Geralt and Siegfried were ambushed on their way to the surface by Salamandra agents. After these were defeated, Siegfried sarcastically asked whether they were friends of the witcher's, then on a more sober note mentioned a friend who might be of service in defeating this organization: Raymond Maarloeve, a private detective living in the Temple Quarter just above the sewers.Siegfried then spent most of the following days at his post (if he and Geralt joined forces in the sewers, this is the Order outpost north of the Cloister; if not, it is at the front entrance to St. Lebioda's Hospital), at one point making a brief excursion to the swamp - but first, he waited by the gate to the dike in order to help Geralt past its guards. He could also be invited to Shani's party. Later on, he was moved before the Cloister's main entrance and advised Geralt on a couple of happenings.If Geralt has consistently supported the Order: Siegfried became a key ally to Geralt and started realizing that Jacques de Aldersberg is descending down a path of madness with mutated Greater brothers and other similar monstrosities designed to defeat both the Scoia'tael under Yaevinn and forces loyal to King Foltest.If Geralt has consistently supported the Scoia'tael: Siegfried became yet another fanatic who blindingly believed in words of the Grand Master and considered the witcher to be traitor, becoming his sworn enemy.[3]After the death of Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg, the Order de facto lost its ground in Temeria and parts of Aedirn. The Order's Supreme Council convened not long after and Siegfried was chosen as the next Grand Master.[2] The assembly also accepted King Radovid V's proposal to become a special force of Redania and moved to that kingdom's northern parts where they began to build Castle Barienmurg, the main stronghold of territories granted to them as well as one of the largest fortifications in the Northern Kingdoms.At this point, Siegfried still continued his monster hunting but due to an overload of work, he has done so sporadically. When summit of monarchs and mages was being prepared at Loc Muinne in July 1271, Radovid summoned Siegfried and his knights to oversee the security.Iorweth's path: Siegfried stepped in to allow Geralt safe passage into Loc Muinne through the Order's Camp, though Iorweth nevertheless had to find an alternate route.Roche's path: Siegfried vouched for both Geralt and Vernon Roche when entering Loc Muinne and meeting Radovid. Siegfried believed in Geralt's innocence regardless of the path the witcher has taken and also stated he owes Geralt too much to stand against him as well as talking about Radovid's ambition, the reformation of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and the Order's view on peasant rebellions."

"131","Bernard Ducat","Human","Male","Spymaster When in cover: Fence (The Witcher) Cobbler (The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt)"," King Foltest of Temeria","Bernard Ducat, better known as Thaler, was a master spy and the former head of Temerian Intelligence during the 1270s.Sometime prior to 1270, Thaler was already the head of Temerian Intelligence, where he helped with various spy activities as well as more unusual tasks, such as sending some of his men out to hunt down catoblepas for their meat, as it was Adda the White's favorite dish.During this time a young Shani happened to be in Vizima and, taking a liking to her, Thaler asked her out, but hid who he really was. However, one night while they wandered the city, Shani noticed two spies following them and eventually the inept men accidentally revealed that Thaler was, in fact, the head of Temerian Intelligence, ending their short relationship.Eventually in 1270, Thaler began to pose as a fence in the city to gather intel and was visited by Coleman, who sold him some witcher equipment he'd found. Thaler eventually sold this off to the guards, not realizing it'd soon lead to him crossing paths with the witcher Geralt, who was also looking for the owner of the sword. During this time, King Foltest also left the city for a bit and personally put Thaler in charge while he was away.Shortly after, Geralt visited and, after Thaler revealed what he knew about Berengar, the two parted ways only to meet up again later during an important reception for high class society. However, this time Thaler was now using his real identity, Bernard, and revealed to Geralt who he really was. He eventually asked a favor for a favor and had Geralt retrieve a mysterious letter, not revealing he believed someone was forging documents as Foltest. With the newest letter in hand though he was finally able to confirm it, as the letter was supposedly from Foltest stripping Thaler of his position as chief but was missing the king's signature.As the party winded down, Thaler went outside but soon got into an argument with Roderick de Wett, and while the count remarked Thaler was just mad about being fired, Thaler noted de Wett knew more than he was letting on.If Geralt defends Thaler: Thanks to the witcher stepping in, Thaler was saved from being killed by de Wett and his men. He then asked Geralt to meet him back in the inn to talk and Thaler revealed all the evidence he'd gathered on the forged documents.If Geralt kills him or walks away: With no one else to protect him and outnumbered, Thaler was quickly killed. Game continuation: Note that this is one of the few times in the games where your choice has no effect and Thaler will appear alive in the third game, even if killed here and you imported saves all the way through.After Nilfgaard invaded Temeria in late 1271, they quickly dismantled the kingdom's secret service and Thaler barely escaped with his life. Not knowing what else to do, he proceeded to drink away his sorrows until his ""liver screamed bloody murder"" then decided he had to do something about the situation. Shortly thereafter he got into contact with Vernon Roche and Sigismund Dijkstra and the three decided something extremely drastic had to be done: King Radovid V of Redania had to die.Using his experience as Temeria's former spymaster, he began to recruit new spies and took on the role of a traveling cobbler by the name of Clogs, noting that cobblers didn't attract any attention while still being able to see and hear all the people around them while they worked.If Geralt takes part in A Deadly Plot: While relatively safe from being harassed by soldiers, Thaler found himself instead attacked by a group of rock trolls who wanted shoes of their own. Geralt eventually found and extracted Thaler from them and Thaler made it safely to the Seven Cats Inn.During Chapter II, Thaler can be found in his house and sometimes walking around through the streets of the Temple Quarter. His house doubles as his shop, in the southeastern section of the Temple Quarter, just around the corner from the dungeon. There he can be called upon to buy and sell a variety of goods. He also plays dice and offers a quiet drinking atmosphere and a free place to stay.Thaler will buy and sell:"

"135","Toruviel","Elf (Aen Seidhe)","Female",NA," Scoia'tael Vrihedd Brigade Filavandrel aén Fidháil","Toruviel aep Sihiel was a free elf from Dol Blathanna or the Blue Mountains. Originally a subject of Filavandrel, she became a Scoia'tael member and later joined the Vrihedd Brigade.Toruviel was part of the squad responsible for contacting Torque, a sylvan spying in Lower Posada for the elves to help them get food and learn agriculture. When their agent was endangered by the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who'd been hired to deal with the sylvan, she was among those who knocked out the witcher and the bard Dandelion and proceeded to tie them up.When the two woke up, Toruviel began to berate the bard and beat him before breaking his lute. Enraged at this, Geralt provoked Toruviel to come closer and, despite being tied up, managed to headbutt the elf, breaking her nose. With that, Toruviel made to kill the witcher but lost control and broke down crying while the other elves proceeded to bandage her nose.Later, after Dana Méadbh intervened and prevented Geralt and Dandelion's execution, the still-bandaged Toruviel gave Dandelion her own lute to replace the one she had destroyed.[1]When Scoia'tael units were formed to fight humans, Toruviel joined a commando together with Yaevinn and Cairbre aep Diared. In June 1267, while the three were on reconnaissance, she kicked Yaevinn to wake him up after Cairbre noticed a lone rider on the road from Tretogor to Aedirn. Though Toruviel tried to discourage her comrade, stating one lone human wasn't worth the effort, Yaevinn shot the commander, unaware that sparing his life would have prevented the provocation at Glevitzingen and the subsequent war.[2]Later, in early August, Toruviel and Ciaran aep Dearbh were wounded and guided by Milva to Col Serrai for healing. Not long after though, the two received news that Coinneach Dá Reo's commando was recruiting new elves and went to join him despite Milva's objections.[3]Toruviel and Yaevinn took part in the Battle of Brenna as members of the Vrihedd Brigade under Isengrim Faoiltiarna. At one point in the battle Menno Coehoorn ordered Vrihedd to strike at the point where Redanians under Kobus de Ruyter stood near the Temerians.[4] Toruviel took part in the charge and was wounded in her arm by a 15 year old Redanian pikeman just before she cut his skull. She did not feel pain until the brigade breached the frontline and reached the tents and wagons.[5] There, Yaevinn broke into Rusty's tent, murdering the wounded until he saw a Nilfgaardian. Toruviel called to him to retreat after Blenheim Blenckert's reinforcements arrived.After the defeat at Brenna, a still wounded Toruviel and 7 other members of her commando fled. They spent some time in the forest, starving and pursued by White Rayla. During this time the ""commando"" met Lucienne's wagon with invalid Temerian veterans inside. Despite her comrades remarking to ""keep dignity"" and not look the humans in the eye, Tourviel did so and, while the veterans were initially scared of the elves, they handed food over to the broken elves before the commando continued to flee into the forests.[4]Later during the escape, Toruviel realized that the blood flow, fever, and fainting slowed their escape down. She left her bow, arrows, horse, and comrades and headed for one of the refugee camps they had encountered before. When she approached their campfire, she dropped her sword and asked for help after which she just fainted. Luckily, an old priestess of Melitele, Tammira, along with a young novice, prevented a hasty young bloke nicknamed ""the Eye"" from killing the elf on the spot and started to tend to her wounds.In the morning the refugees decamped and got into their carts, taking Toruviel with them despite the Eye's protests. Toruviel was still far too weak and while she often napped thanks to Tammira's medicines, she had nightmares about slaughtered corpses around a temple ruin in the forest. Near the temple, she heard the voice of a divine being calling to her.During one of the stopovers, one of the refugees was found dead, having been killed by a forest predator. While Toruviel suspected a wolf or wyvern, an old villager theorized that it must had been a shape-shifting dragon and speculated that dragons particularly like to take the form of elves. He eventually changed his mind later that night when the camp was attacked by leshens in the form of spiked wildcats and old men with xyloid arms. Toruviel and the refugees managed to repel the monsters, but a couple of humans died and most of the hens were eaten.Toruviel, suspecting that the attacks could be connected with the deity-like being from her nightmares, asked Tammira to prepare a hallucinogenic decoction so that she could contact the being and localize it. After making contact, she suspected it to be some demon or a vampire wanting elven blood, and the refugees' leader sent her along with the novice (to tend to her wounds) and the Eye (to prevent her from escaping) to investigate the ruins shown to Toruviel by the unknown being. Before reaching their destination, the Eye became less belligerent towards her and even called her ""a spunky chick"".The ""being"" turned out to be Aderill of the Golden Forests: an Aen Elle mage investigating the ruins with two henchmen. Using Elder Speech, he explained that five of the remaining seven members of Toruviel's commando were murdered there by humans, which activated the altar - an artifact which turned out to be a key to an Ard Gaeth, a Gates between worlds. Ideally, the portal should be fueled by elven blood, but humans' would do the job, so he had seized control over leshens to kidnap refugees and keep the portal open. He proposed Toruviel to go back with him so that she could be healed, and presented a vision of using the refugees' deaths to buy time for the Aen Seidhe to evacuate from the area. Toruviel objected, terrified and disgusted of the idea, explaining that all the elves from the area were killed at Brenna and spilling innocent blood would help no one. Aderill became incensed, suspecting her to have a delirium and stated the Ard Gaeth would turn the tide of the war with the Unicorns. However, before he could cast a spell to stun Toruviel and order his men to kill the Eye and the novice, Toruviel managed to throw a sword at him, preventing the mage from spellcasting, and the Eye killed the two remaining Aen Elle warriors with the novice's help. The fight weakened Toruviel and just before she fainted she asked her human companions to burn the bodies so that the portal would not activate again.Toruviel did not die however, but awakened some time later, when the refugees reached their home village. Her arm was in better condition and Tammira said that the blokes destroyed the temple and the bodies were burned as she had asked. She called her ""Tor"" and promised that the villagers would hide her from White Rayla.[5]For more information, see #The Witcher.Toruviel eventually returned to her warrior life and joined Yaevinn's new commando near Vizima.[6]Just like Yaevinn in the Swamp, Toruviel appears as the leader of a Scoia'tael group at the Lakeside. Unlike the books, Toruviel is presented as being of lower (if only slightly) rank than Yaevinn. In the books, the reverse is true and the disparity in rank greater. According to White Rayla at the end of Chapter IV, Toruviel's 'full name' is Toruviel Aep Shihiel.Depending on which path Geralt follows, Toruviel is a possible sexual encounter and the conversation between the witcher and the elf, pre-encounter, is a lot of fun."

"137","Triss Merigold","Human","Female","Advisor Mage"," King Foltest of Temeria Lodge of Sorceresses Temerian Royal Council","Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with the latter.[2] Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.Not much is known about Triss' upbringing. Not even a precise time of her birth, which is a subject to some degree of confusion - see below. What is known is the fact, that she was born and lived as a child in Maribor. Sometime during her childhood, she had a conduit moment and was noticed by sorcerers. Thus, she found her way to Aretuza. Here, she became a sorceress on her own, specializing in making of magical potions, mainly healing ones. This was rather amusing twist of fate as she herself was alergic to magical potions and could only tolerate non magical ones.After the graduation, she became a very well known and respected sorceress taking her assignment as a advisor to the throne of Temeria.During her studies, she befriended a fellow sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg. During 1249, which is a time when a story ""The Last Wish"" takes place, the two of them were already close friends and colleagues.Some time later, Triss found out about her friend's on and off relations with Geralt of Rivia. Curious about the nature of that relationship, she used a magic and seduced the witcher, resulting in them spending time together in Kaer Morhen as lovers. During those time, Triss became very good friend with some of the other witchers, Vesemir and Eskel. The former liked her so much that he started to call her ""little daughter"". Since then, she was always welcome in the witcher's keep.After some time however, the spell faded and Geralt simply ended the relationship. This proved to be a very difficult for Triss as she fell in deep love with Geralt. Despite that, the two of them remained very good friends in years to come and even though Triss was still unhappily in love with him, he did not wish to start anew.When the Great War with Nilfgaard started and the Kingdom of Cintra was destroyed, sorcerers under the leadership of Vilgefortz of Roggeveen decided to stand with the North and manned an old Elven ruin on Sodden Hill. Here, they wanted to stop the invading forces. Triss was among those who volunteered. The battle was brutal and the mages stood against incredibly strong forces but in the end, they managed to defeat the invaders. The cost of victory was high, though, as 13 mages died. As a matter of fact, it was first believed that the number of dead was 14 - the last one being Triss. She was very seriously wounded, not only sustaining a deep cut on her chest, but also having all of her hair burnt off. With Yennefer, the only mage that would have still recognised her, blinded during the battle, she was counted amongst the dead.When Geralt rode near Sodden some time later, he saw the memory stone erected in remembrance of those who gave their lives to protect the North. Triss was among them, which saddened Geralt very deeply. When it was later discovered that Triss had indeed managed to survive the battle, she became known as ""the fourteenth of the hill"".Not long after the battle, Triss received a message from Geralt, asking her to come to Kaer Morhen, to help him with his Child of Surprise - Ciri. Ciri was trained by the witchers, yet she started to show some strong magical abilities that were beyond what was conventional for witchers. Thus, Triss accepted and went there, but she was reluctant to be near Geralt again as her feelings for him had not faded. During her stay, she constantly struggled with the way she felt but she eventually managed to clear her mind and do her job. Ciri, as she discovered, was a young lady with sad history and the two of them took liking to each other instantly. Their bond was so strong that Ciri started to consider Triss her older sister and vice versa. Some disquiet between Triss and the witchers surfaced when Triss discovered that the witchers want to submit Ciri to special potions. While not as invasive as the Trial of the Grasses, the potions would still cause harm to her body and most likely leave her barren. She begged them not to give her those, and eventually they agreed.The other problem was that Ciri slowly became a woman and, being only girl in the keep, she had nobody to ask about specifics that comes with that. When Triss discovered that Ciri had no idea about her own cycles and that the witchers were unaware of them as well, she was furious. Since then, whenever Ciri came in dress, the training would stop until she change to the training attire.More problematic, however, was her increasingly strong proficiency with magic. Witchers told Triss, that since Ciri came to the keep, she had 3 incidents where she spoke a different voice in unrecognizable language and had trance - like state. In the last one, she also foretold the death of Geralt. They said that the first time it happened was after Ciri accidently drunk a potion, the same potion, that now stood before Triss. When Ciri came, Triss tricked her into drinking said potion to the shock of all the witchers. She told them however, that she knows what she is doing. Ciri started to dance and not long after fell into a trance. Triss teleptaically connected with her and tried to find out what is the problem. While connected to the young girl, she felt a strong presence inside her. Triss used all her power and identification spells but it all proved futile. This battle of wills proved very draining and Triss passed out.Later, she woke in her bed with Geralt next to her. He told her that she was out for six hours and ensured her that Ciri is alright and sleeps in her room. The sorceress told Geralt that whatever bounds with Ciri is way too powerfull for her and that he should contact Yennefer, who is more knowledgable about such things. Geralt was reluctant, considering their past, but Triss insisted it would be the best for the girl. After Geralt agreed, Triss told him that when spring comes, they should take Ciri to the Temple of Melitele. The witcher agreed and then spent the night with the old friend, taking care of her.Next few months, Triss spent every day with Ciri and tought her various topics, including the Elder Speech. But she also showed her a delicacy of make-up. As the spring neared the witchers were slowly preparing to go on the path once again and they wanted to know all the relevant news from the continent so to decide where to go.Triss told them everything she knew and they eventually talked about the possibility of second war with Nilfgaard. This resulted in a heated debate about witchers and their neutrality.That night, they decided that with the morning light, they will go to the temple.Triss, along with Geralt and Ciri went on the way. Not long after, Triss became ill, having very strong stomach ache. Her illness was worse and worse to such a state, that she was not able to hold herself in the saddle. Thus Geralt had to carry her on his horse. But even with that, they were slow and had to stop for the sorceress to relieve herself.Eventually they arrived to a village. This however proved not a good sign, because the settlement was attacket by elven commandos of Scoia'tael. Triss was laid down with the other wounded while Geralt went to find out what are their options. He learned about the attack and the planned retaliation. However he knew, they have noone, who could cure Triss. What was worse, the men started to think, that Triss may have some infection that could spread. Even though Geralt told them, that mages cannot have an infection due to their immunity, and that it had to be a case of food poisoning, they did not want her there.Thus the trio was forced to go on. Fortunately, Geralt learned about a convoy that went the same way as they need to so they rode to them. There they discovered that in the convoy was an old friend, dwarf Yarpen Zigrin. Geralt persuaded Yarpen and a knight in charge of the convoy to allow the trio to join them. Triss was laid to one of the vagons but her state was still very severe. She was no longer able to relieve herself on her own and Geralt had to carry her into the woods. Other dwars watched this with a surprise. They were not sure if they would do the same for their own wives. When Ciri told them, that Triss and Geralt were not couple but friends, they could not believed it.They continued of the way and Triss started to feel better. But she was still very weak thus Geralt and Ciri had to help her with bathing and clothing. As a matter of fact, despite her state, Triss rather enjoyed Geralt holding her so tightly and caring for her.Sometime later the convoy was approached by soldiers from Kaedwen. Those soldiers warned the men that Scoia'tael are near so they should continue very carefully. Not long after that, the elves indeed attacked the convoy. Triss was thrown out of the vagon and had nasty wound on her head. The attack was swift but the defenders managed to repel it. By that time, Triss was well enough, to be able to take care of the wounded and help them with her magic.The rest of the journey was without any incident and they succesfully arrived in the temple. Triss then went on her own giving her farewells to both Ciri and Geralt.Triss is a major character in The Witcher computer game. She is one of the first people Geralt meets after being found unconscious in the woods by his fellow witchers.She is also the one to nurse Geralt back to health after his first battle with Azar Javed in the Swamp. Once Geralt regains consciousness, he finds himself in the bedroom of her luxurious Trade Quarter home, and he sees her talking presumably to another sorceress. She diligently ""checks him for internal injuries"".For the main article, see The Witcher romance.PrologueDuring the prologue, after dealing with the Salamandra invasion of Kaer Morhen, Triss is gravely wounded and needs a special potion which Geralt must brew to help her recover. If not rushed during the dialogue, after drinking the potion, she offers Geralt his first sexual encounter of the game.Chapter IIIIf it was Triss and not Shani who was chosen to take care of Alvin the second romance option becomes available if she is given a ruby ring, and in regards to Alvin, Geralt must be strict at least once.Triss plays a major role throughout the story. She first appears in the prologue as Geralt's lover; her feelings for him have evidently remained unchanged. Triss assists Geralt and Foltest in taking La Valette castle. She gets separated from them when a dragon attacks Foltest's forces. After Geralt is imprisoned for Foltest's murder, she meets up with him and Vernon Roche before they set sail for Flotsam, having lost her position as advisor after Foltest's death. In Flotsam, she meets with fellow Lodge member, Síle de Tansarville, and becomes suspicious of her presence. She helps Geralt prepare to fight a kayran by introducing him to Cedric, finding the Kayran's lair, and helping him create a potion to allow Geralt to resist the beast's poison. After Geralt meets Letho, Triss and Cedric break into Síle's room and Triss uses the megascope to try to gain more information on Síle (by speaking either to Dethmold or Philippa). Shortly after, Letho abducts Triss and forces her to teleport them to Vergen.In Vergen, Triss gets away from Letho and tries to make contact with Philippa. She finds Philippa's room, but comes upon Philippa's apprentice, Cynthia, there instead. Cynthia, a Nilfgaardian spy, captures Triss using Artefact compression, and smuggles Triss across the mist of wraiths, where Triss eventually makes it into the hands of Nilfgaard's ambassador, Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. Before Geralt can rescue her, Shilard takes his ship to Loc Muinne.In Loc Muinne, he commissioned the help of Assire var Anahid to decompress Triss. Triss is restrained and interrogated for more information of the Lodge. If Geralt chooses not to save her, in favor of helping Roche or Iorveth, a massacre erupts in Loc Muinne, with opposing forces fighting not only one another, but also mages after Nilfgaard revealed the Lodge's involvement with the Northern regicides. In the chaos, Letho saves Triss from the Nilfgaardian camp, and takes her to the now abandoned Temerian camp and protects her until Geralt arrives after fighting the dragon. Once Geralt reaches the camp, Triss steps away, while the two witchers talk.If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss, he breaks into the Nifgaard camp and eventually finds her restrained and asks her about the Lodge and their influence behind the Demavend and Foltest's murders. When Geralt and Triss go to the amphitheater, Triss reveals Síle's role in the assassinations, allowing Carduin to reject Síle from joining the reformed Conclave of Mages. Triss and Geralt are separated again when Geralt goes to fight the dragon, and they meet up shortly afterwards, where Triss tells Geralt that Letho is waiting for him. On their way to Letho, Triss explains that mages helped prevent further bloodshed in the city. Regardless whether Geralt rescued her or not, after Geralt confronts Letho, he leaves Loc Muinne with Triss (and maybe with Roche or Iorveth).For the main article, see The Witcher 2 romance.Triss is the default romance option - the game begins with her and Geralt already in a relationship. One of three opening scenes of Geralt's story during the prologue shows him getting up as Triss lies naked beside him as a messenger soldier enters their tent to summon the witcher to the King Foltest's side.The first real opportunity arises near the end of Chapter I during the quest The Rose of Remembrance. When given the option to go to the elven baths, Geralt can choose to take the sorceress along with him. After a battle partway through the quest, the ground under their feet collapses, sending the two plummeting into ancient elven baths. Noting that an immediate escape is impossible, the two can take advantage of their location. Selecting the correct conversation options will initiate a cutscene, in which Triss completely takes off her clothes with magic and jumps into the water. Our Witcher soon joins her in the bath. After the lovers enjoyed one another well enough, Triss comments this short time of bliss in such a manner: ""We should take walks more often. For a while there, I forgot all about Flotsam, the Scoia'tael, the kingslayer, the whole world really..."".Since March 31, 2015, Triss Merigold is a new playable character in the MOBA ""The Witcher Battle Arena"".Triss returns in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as the leader of the mage underground due to the witch hunt begun by Radovid V. Her appearance did not change much but interactions with Yennefer prove quite interesting. There is also a free DLC which gives Triss an alternative outfit.After the events at Loc Muinne Triss and Geralt (who had now regained his memory) separated. Triss decided to go to Novigrad, which many mages believed to be a safe haven, and set up a shop in the city center. The Eternal Fire religion in the city, however, declared all mages to be witches and traitors and began arresting and murdering them.Triss was forced to seek the protection of The King of Beggars to whom she paid 80% of her earnings whilst attempting to gain enough money to escape the city with her fellow mages. Geralt, upon arriving at the city, found Triss with the King of Beggars and assisted her ridding a rat infested mill. The Mill owner, however, sold her out to the witch hunters, and if not for the efforts of Geralt, Triss would have been captured.Triss accompanies Sigismund Dijkstra to Margrave Henckel's house to meet with Geralt, who was searching for Dijkstra's lost treasure; Triss agreed to stick her neck out in exchange for Dijkstra's financial aid in smuggling the mages out of Novigrad. After Geralt told Dijkstra that Caleb Menge, the leader of the witch hunters, had his treasure, and after the ex-spy had left, the witcher informed Triss that Menge had Dandelion imprisoned. To find Ciri, Triss then helped Geralt discover the location of Dandelion by allowing herself to be taken to the witch hunters and tortured whilst Geralt gained the information. Ultimately she kills her torturers before killing Menge.If Geralt assists Triss in spiriting all the mages under her wing to Kovir, it results in the witch hunters targeting nonhumans. Helping Triss ensures she goes to Kaer Morhen to fight the Wild Hunt. Before the Hunt's attack, she is happily reunited with Ciri, whom she provides with a magical stone that will call down a fireball that would strike down all her attackers except herself.Following the battle, Triss goes with Yennefer and Avallac'h to Novigrad to try and reunite the Lodge of Sorceresses, taking up residence at the Rosemary and Thyme, an establishment owned by Dandelion. Unfortunately, they had not much luck, as Ida Emean outright refused and Francesca Findabair wouldn't budge from her realm with a war raging.When Geralt later arrived, Triss berates him for putting Ciri in danger by taking her to the Sabbath to face Imlerith. Afterwards, she informed him that the only Lodge member she could locate was Philippa Eilhart, who was tricked into her owl form by Arthur de Vleester, who put a dimeritium band on her leg afterwards. Worse yet, Philippa came into the possession of Zoltan Chivay, who lost her in a card game. Luckily, Triss found a feather. Using hydromancy at the fountain behind the Passiflora and divined that Philippa was in the possession of Sigismund Dijkstra. They rush to his bathhouse, where Philippa, having regained human form after Dijkstra foolishly removed her dimeritium band, was wreaking havoc. After Geralt managed to subdue her, Triss led her colleague to safety.HugGeralt can reignite his romance with Triss in separate stages. While extracting Lady Ingrid Vegelbud's son from her estate past the witch hunters, Triss gets drunk, which leads to Geralt kissing her as the fireworks start. At the conclusion of Now or Never, if Geralt professes his love for Triss and kissed her previously, she seemingly departs on the ship for Kovir. But she returns, interrupting Sigismund Dijkstra's anecdote about his affair with Phillipa Eilhart. She asks to speak privately with Geralt at the lighthouse, where they have sex.While searching for Phillipa using hydromancy, Triss' spell in the reflection of the pool behind the Passiflora, changes to an unknown house. When pressed by Geralt, she reveals that King Tankred had offered her a position as his court advisor. She also reveals that the house is to be hers in Pont Vanis, where she wants them to live together after the Wild Hunt is defeated.If Geralt finds one of Triss' lost earrings in their bed back at Kaer Morhen, he can return it to her. During the epilogue, Geralt and Triss settle in far-away Kovir. Geralt would take jobs, more out of habit than need, due to the fortune Triss received as the advisor to Kovir's king. If Geralt romances both Triss and Yennefer, they trick him into thinking they're having a threesome, only to leave him tied to the bed in the Rosemary and Thyme.If Geralt romanced Triss in the main game, then she makes an appearance during Geralt's adventures in Toussaint.After the quest Blood Run, Geralt receives a letter from Triss that begins the quest Turn and Face the Strange. The letter is read in her voice and not only details the discovery she made about Professor Moreau's research, but also expresses a desire that Geralt remain safe and return to her quickly.During the quest The Warble of a Smitten Knight, Geralt can make the necessary vow for the knights' tourney on ""his lady's love"". In which case, he will say ""I vow on the love of my lady, Triss Merigold, to respect the chivalric virtues"".After the main questline for Blood and Wine is complete, Geralt can return to his home in Corvo Bianco and is surprised by Triss, who is waiting for him. After an embrace, the two venture outside to a sunny spot overlooking the vineyard. Once there, they have a conversation about various topics, including current events in Kovir and romantic plans the two have for each other in the future."

In King Foltest's absence, Velerad held the highest authority in the city.Velerad served as castellan of Vizima for several years, and saw Princess Adda die due to a miscarriage, and then rise as a striga years later.Once he met the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who was bought to him after the witcher killed three racists during a brawl in a local inn. The witcher bought up his true purpose for visiting the city, to cure the curse of Adda the White. Velerad explained the curse and the reward for saving her, and then went with him to the new palace, where they met with Foltest, Segelin and Ostrit. After the king left, the four other men spent a while discussing the appearance and history of the striga, before the witcher left to prepare for his contract.Later, after Adda had been cured and Geralt was recovering in the palace, Velerad went and saw him, telling him about her transformation, though the witcher passed out mid-conversation due to exhaustion.In the game, Velerad enjoyed the distinction of being the burgomeister of Vizima. He could be found on the ground level of the guardhouse in the Trade Quarter after Gold Rush. The rumors flying around town suggested that he is ineffective in his role and spends most of his days drinking. Or perhaps this was simply the appearance he wishes to maintain.He was a confidant of Princess Adda and knew about most of the goings on around town, despite what the citizenry considered evidence to the contrary. Technically, Geralt could sneak out during the banquet and see him at the guardhouse as well. (As of Patch 1.4, this may only be possible near the end of A Posh Reception, after the guests left, but before you talked to Leuvaarden again.)Also, if Geralt helped the elves during the bank robbery, since the Enhanced Edition, Velerad became decidedly hostile (will not consent to a game of poker dice).

"142","Vesemir","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher"," School of the Wolf","Vesemir was the oldest and most experienced witcher at Kaer Morhen in the 13th century and acted as a father figure to Geralt and the other witchers. Like many of the other witchers, he spent each winter in the fortress and set out on the path when spring arrived.He was one of the few members of the School of the Wolf to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. By the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; however, as he was only a fencing instructor, he didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples into witchers.[3]Considered among the oldest witchers remaining, Vesemir was born early enough to witness the construction of Kaer Morhen in the 11th century.[4] He was claimed by the Law of Surprise by a mysterious individual known as Deglan[5] and was brought to the Kaer Morhen valley to be trained as a witcher. His mentor and tutor was Barmin.[6]In the second half of the 12th century, Kaer Morhen was attacked by an enraged mob led by group of mages and priests. Vesemir survived, either not present in the keep during the pogrom[3] or mistaken as dead by the mob as he lied unconscious among the corpses of his fellows.[7][N 1] While the pogrom was condemned, the school never regained its full functionality.[3]Vesemir accompanied by witchers-in-trainingAfter the massacre, the school was run by Grandmaster Rennes, with Vesemir as second in command: a fencing instructor and precept for the witcher trainees,[1] replacing Varin.[6] At some point, he met Visenna outside Kaer Morhen, a sorceress who decided to give her child, a young boy named Geralt, to train as a witcher.[8] Vesemir became a father figure to Geralt,[9] but treated all young witchers with harsh affection.[1] Apart from participating in the school's life, Vesemir also took some witcher contracts. One of his famous deeds involved disenchanting the curse afflicting the ""Swan of Poviss"".[6]For some time, the School of the Wolf was funded by the monarchs of Kaedwen alongside the School of the Cat. Vesemir had to reluctantly cooperate with Guxart, the fencing master of the Cats. Originally not liking each other, the two grew to understand one another. The cooperation between the schools unfortunately had to cease, as the Cat Grandmaster Treyse and a group of students had secretly conspired with King Radowit II and the mage Astrogarus against the Wolves. A week before the planned tournament between the schools Vesemir and Guxart were put under arrest by king's men, thus spared from the massacre that occured. During the tournament, King Radowit betrayed both Cats and Wolves ordering his soldiers to shoot them all, resolving both his budget problems and imagined threats to his power in a simple but effective way.[1]Both masters – or, technically, acting grandmasters since Treyse's and Rennes's deaths – were released some time later and allowed to rebuild the schools, on the condition that the royal money would be never given to them again and that the schools must operate alone and unfunded.[1] The schools declined slowly, and the deaths of mage assistants and veteran witchers put a definite end to the Wolf School by the late 1230s or early 1240s, as children were no longer trained there after then.[3]During the winter of 1234, while fulfilling a contract in Oxenfurt, Vesemir briefly dated young lady Mignole. After noticing each other from afar, Vesemir received a secret letter from the woman inviting him. The two had a tryst, which was unfortunately interrupted by Mignole's father who'd learned of the affair. Vesemir fled, leaving his gambeson behind in the process, and had an arrest warrant for him put out by the father.[2]Wolves in their lairEven though the school ceased to function, Vesemir and other witchers used to spend winters at Kaer Morhen. He allowed some non-Wolf witchers such as Coën[3], but forbade the entrance for the renegades, as in case of Brehen whose massacre at Iello was exceptional even amongst the other Cats.[10]Likely around 1242,[N 2] Vesemir hosted Eskel's Surprise Child, Deidre Ademeyn, at the keep, which prompted a dyplomatic conflict with her brother and King Henselt's vassal, Merwin Ademeyn: Deidre was first in line to the throne, which did not suit her brother well. Ultimately the princess left the castle, however not without leaving a disfiguring scar at Eskel's face.[11]Old VesemirDecades later, Geralt brought his surprise child, Cirilla, princess of Cintra, to be trained as a witcher. Vesemir taught her about the different monsters and herbs, leaving the physical training to Geralt, Eskel, Lambert, and Coën. However, the witchers soon found out that Ciri was a source, as she entered into a trance when she accidentally drank white seagull. The third time, Ciri foretold the deaths of Geralt and Coën. The witchers then decided to summon an old friend, the sorceress Triss Merigold, to help Ciri, under that pretext that Vesemir's bones ached. Triss imposed some conditions to the witchers as she made them see the errors in their ways of treating Ciri, and Vesemir accepted the conditions despite the initial protests of some of the witchers.[3]In May 1272, on the trail of Yennefer, Geralt and Vesemir rode to White Orchard, where at a ford they encountered a merchant being trapped by a royal griffin. While fighting it, the old witcher suffered deep clawing to the shoulder. After freeing the man, they rode into the village to the local inn, and the two spoke to the innkeeper, Elsa, while a tense atmosphere filled the tavern. After Geralt met Gaunter O'Dimm, he spoke to Vesemir and decided to go to the Nilfgaardian Garrison.After getting some buckthorn to lure the beast, Geralt and Vesemir waited in a field hidden with bait set out, and after the griffin landed, Vesemir gave Geralt his crossbow that he had won gambling. After the beast was killed, and Geralt had handed in its trophy, him and his old master headed back to the inn, where they were violently attacked by some racists. Following their deaths, the two witchers were shunned and told to leave, where they encountered Yennefer and a Nilfgaardian escort outside the inn. Yennefer explained that Emperor Emhyr var Emreis had summoned Geralt to Vizima, so Vesemir decided that he would head north to Kaer Morhen.[6]Vesemir spent the next couple of weeks working at Kaer Morhen, patching crumbled walls, with Eskel and Lambert, until Yennefer showed up, preparing the witchers for Geralt and Uma's return to the keep, much to Vesemir's annoyance, as she showed little care for manners. Once Geralt arrived, everyone set out to prepare for the Trial of the Grasses that was to be performed on Uma, who Vesemir looked after until the trail was ready, taking him to the mountains, where he noticed in moments of complete relaxation, he behaved differently. Vesemir then put him into a trance and Uma spoke in a different voice. They all met the following morning and Geralt brewed the The Decoctions of the Grasses and started the trial on Uma, which Vesemir helped with but hated watching, remembering the painful history of their school. He slept through the trial until the end, when Uma transformed into Avallac'h, an elven sage, who revealed that Ciri was on the Isle of Mists and Geralt needed to find her. He also told them that when they took Ciri from the isle, the Wild Hunt would be able find her immediately, so Vesemir suggested that Geralt bring Ciri to Kaer Morhen and they all face the Wild Hunt together. He planned to spend the time preparing the keep for the coming battle with Eskel and Lambert.[6]After Geralt and Ciri returned via portal from the Isle of Mists, she was overjoyed to see Vesemir. Yennefer, Triss Merigold, Ciri, Geralt and Vesemir all discussed things and then headed into the main keep. On the way Vesemir discussed flammable gasses and patching up walls with Ermion. Then all the people that had turned up discussed battle plans in the main keep, with Vesemir suggesting that they brew potions in the laboratory and use tools to clear the rubble blocking access to the armory, and then he and Geralt finished it off by laying out the final plan.After a couple of hours, the Wild Hunt attacked, and Vesemir fought them on the walls of the lowest courtyard of the keep, briefly arguing with Ciri because she had left the inner keep against orders. Becoming overwhelmed and with Imlerith's arrival, they decided to retreat to the main courtyard. The Wild Hunt quickly broke through the gate and froze Geralt while Ciri and Vesemir hid at the top of the courtyard. Trying to protect Ciri, Vesemir was attacked by Imlerith, who he stabbed through the leg. He then cut Eredin Bréacc Glas who dropped Ciri, so Vesemir used Aard to push her far away. Imlerith then jumped on him and started beating and choking him, while Eredin started trying to convince Ciri to join him, much to Vesemir's horror. He spoke to Ciri begging her to run before stabbing Imlerith in the side. Imlerith, enraged, broke his neck, ending the old witcher's life.[6]In the game, Vesemir is one of the first people Geralt speaks to upon arrival at Kaer Morhen, and he is the one to guide the amnesiac through his first few uncertain steps around the keep. He also tells the witcher about skinning monsters, an extremely useful skill throughout the rest of the game. Of no less importance is the fact that he introduces the character of Berengar to the plot while filling our hero in on his forgotten past.Vesemir features prominently in the prologue and can usually be found wandering around the main hall on the ground floor of Kaer Morhen, or in the basement in the laboratory.In The Price of Neutrality premium module he is found just inside the walls of Kaer Morhen; more specifically, in the main courtyard. He can be found later near the ford closest to the camp.Vesemir mentoring young CiriVesemir returned in The Witcher 3 as a key character and was voiced by William Roberts once again. The game began with Geralt and his old mentor on the trail of Yennefer, the former having woken from a dream of Kaer Morhen. Whether or not they discussed the dream, Vesemir then requested to see Yennefer's letter, remarking that it smelt of lilacs and gooseberries, Yennefer's preferred perfume. Afterwards, they proceeded onto White Orchard to ask the townsfolk whether they've seen the sorceress in black. Both he and Geralt killed a Griffin in order to earn info regarding Yennefer's location. On their way back to the inn, they were greeted by Yennefer in person. There, Vesemir separated from Geralt, wanting to return to Kaer Morhen to hide its path from the Northern realms and the Empire of Nilfgaard as they waged war on one another.Vesemir disappeared for the majority of the game until Geralt returned to Kaer Morhen with Yennefer, then Ciri, where a group of resistance fighters were formed to fend off the Wild Hunt. During the battle, the King of the Wild Hunt detonated a magical explosion that froze all opposition, where only Vesemir and Ciri were unscathed. Vesemir tried to retreat with Ciri in tow but was immediately confronted by Eredin and Imlerith, the king and the second in command of the Wild Hunt respectively. Vesemir fended them off until Imlerith disarmed him, Ciri was then ready to surrender herself to the Hunt in order to spare everyone involved. In a last-ditch effort, but Vesemir stabbed Imlerith in the abdomen with a hidden dagger, causing the Aen Elle general to snap his neck, killing him. Distraught at this, Ciri unleashed her power in a massive soundwave of energy that forced the Hunt to retreat. After the battle, Vesemir was then given a funeral and honored as a hero against the Wild Hunt, Ciri took his Wolf medallion as a memento."

Vesna, not wanting to ""shock"" her grandmother, recommends the old mill and plans to bring food, making wine the witcher's responsibility. Vesna will be waiting just outside the old mill every day from 19:30 onward, and will leave at 23:00. If you get her home before 22:01 during the escort, she will proceed to the mill instead of going inside. Otherwise she will appear and leave instantaneously and will not walk from or to her grandmother's house.If you remember the wine (any medium alcohol is sufficient; if you fail to give her a proper drink twice she will give you a hint on what she wants and where to get it), Vesna will have enough liquid courage to brave the ""haunted"" mill, and the two of you head inside for what sounds like a vigorously good time while the neighbours across the river wax superstitious.Note: As stated above Vesna will be waiting every night until you meet her, however there is a point in the game where she will no longer wait for you at the appointed time. If you turn in both The Salamander's Tail's ""Trust gained"", as well as Of Monsters and Men's ""Alvin's Prophecy"" stages prior to meeting with her you will lose your chance of receiving her Romance card. Turning in either stage is fine, however due to the nature of both quests it is easy to accidentally turn in both at the same time in the same dialog, locking you out of the option (outside prior saves of course). It is therefore advised to meet with her prior to turning in either stage."

During the Battle of Brenna, where he was part of the Vrihedd Brigade, he and his commando entered in the medic tent of Rusty and started to kill all the patients but they immediately stopped when they saw that the medic and his assistants were healing wounded people from both the factions, making no difference between Nilfgaardians and Nordlings.He was later seriously injured in that battle but in the end he survived to the wounds.Yaevinn appears in Chapter II of the game. He treats Geralt with hesitant respect and appeals to him to aid his faction; he reminds him that as a mutant, he would never be accepted in human society, only tolerated and could better relate to the cause of the Scoia'tael. He is eloquent and often speaks in verse, employing metaphors and literary allusions to convey his meaning.If the witcher chooses to ally himself with the Scoia'tael, Yaevinn plays an even more central role in the story. It is also Toruviel who is a member of Yaevinn's group rather than the other way around, although he does not seem to outrank her by much.On Iorveth's path during Chapter II, the Scoia'tael leader will discuss Yaevinn's legacy with Geralt in Vergen if the latter sided with the Scoia'tael or remained neutral in The Witcher.Yaevinn, same as Iorveth, does not appear in game and apart from the second one, he is not even mentioned by other characters, but he has his own gwent card as part of Scoia'tael Gwent deck."

She took advantage of Carthia van Canten's relationship with the head of Nilfgaardian Secret Service, Vattier de Rideaux, and used it to spy on him.She was also known for helping Imperator Emhyr var Emreis with military operations during the war. Even though Assire was a Nilfgaardian sorceress, she and Eviva had Nordling blood. She also owned a black cat called Merlin.In 1267, Assire was contacted by Philippa Eilhart to join the creation of a new mage organization. At the risk of her own life, as doing such a thing was forbidden for Nilfgaardian mages, she attended the first meeting via teleportation. On first seeing her, the northern sorceresses were surprised by her unattractive appearance, since northern mages often used glamours while in Nilfgaard it was frowned upon, believing attractiveness was proof of a sorceress' superficial mindset. Assire, along with the other sorceresses, listened to Philippa's proposal to create the Lodge and at the end was asked to invite a second Nilfgaardian sorceress to the next meeting in a couple weeks.[1]Thus she met with fellow countrywoman and sorceress, Fringilla Vigo. Fringilla was surprised that Assire had changed her style, choosing to wear more fashionable attire, as they prepared to leave to meet with the other sorceresses. It was during the meeting with the Lodge, when they discussed Ciri, that Assire revealed that Emhyr did not have Ciri but an impostor.[1]In 1271, she teleported from Nilfgaard to Loc Muinne and met with ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. He presented her Triss Merigold who was under the spell of artefact compression. Assire decompressed Triss and then was immediately restrained and killed by Shilard and Renuald aep Matsen due to her affiliation with the Lodge.[2]Because of the hazy circumstance surrounding her death, many speculations rose in the Empire, fueling propaganda and political conflicts for several years.[2] At one point in Nilfgaard's history, images of sorceresses were destroyed very diligently and thoroughly leaving no relevant source of their appearance for future. In the 14th century, however, all of the Lodge's members were posthumously rehabilitated and given sainthood and martyrdom.[3]"
"172","Auckes","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher (formerly)Assassin"," School of the Viper Kingslayers","Auckes (Polish: Egan) was a witcher of the School of the Viper and a member of the Kingslayers sent to the Northern Kingdoms by Imperator Emhyr var Emreis to wreak havoc. He, along with his brother and fellow witcher, Serrit, took part in both the process of Demavend III's murder on the Pontar and an attempt on Henselt's in the Kaedweni camp near Vergen. The latter was unsuccessful, however, and cost Auckes his life.After Geralt saved Letho's life in Angren, the witcher helped him find the Wild Hunt who had kidnapped Yennefer. Auckes and his brother Serrit formed part of the party of witchers that were tracking down the Wild Hunt.In the winter solstice of 1270, at an event that would come to be known as the night of magic, Auckes took part in the battle of the Hanged Man's Tree, where the witchers faced the riders of the Hunt. Although the witchers fought bravely, they could not kill them all due to being highly outnumbered. A stalemate was reached and after an exchange had taken place (Geralt for Yennefer), the riders took off and the remaining witchers left with Yennefer in tow.After her return, Yennefer was feverish, delirious, in agony, and suffering from amnesia. Out of respect for Geralt, the witchers took care of the sorceress until she was better. However, Yennefer turned out to be quite a handful, trying to seduce Auckes to drive a wedge between the witchers and causing the group endless trouble in Nilfgaard, a kingdom known to have strict rules on mages that could result in her being killed for her unruly behavior. To try and protect her, the group wandered through the provinces of the empire pulling Yennefer out of whatever trouble she would find herself in until one day they got caught by the imperial secret police.They were questioned separately, but no violence was used. After the interrogations, Letho received an offer from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself: kill as many northern kings as he could, and in recompense, the emperor would rebuild the School of the Viper; Letho agreed and recruited some of his fellow Vipers into the task, thus Auckes became part of a group that would be remembered as the Kingslayers.[1]Sometime after Letho managed to slay Demavend III, he met with Auckes in a nearby forest and gave him the former king of Aedirn's head. Auckes initially complained about the head's smell, weight, and size before Letho instructed him to give it to Síle de Tansarville to receive payment and further orders. Thanks to a deal Letho made with Iorveth, Auckes and his fellow kingslayers were temporarily allied with Scoia'tael, who provided them with protection in-between assassinations.[1]Auckes and Serrit in Geralt's visionLater, Auckes and his brother were tasked with assassinating Henselt, the king of Kaedwen. After making their way through the Kaedweni lands, the brothers made their hideout in a network of caves located near the Kaedweni camp and spent their time there, waiting and planning.On the day of the strike, they cleared some harpies outside the cave and proceeded to met with Letho. After a short conversation about the presence of Geralt in the Kaedweni camp and their next move, the witchers set out on their mission. They used the time they had in the walk towards the camp to discuss the events that were to go down at Loc Muinne.After infiltrating the camp, Auckes secured the ground floor by disposing of the guards, then proceeded to rendezvous with Serrit and together fought the knights that were defending the king. When they were ready to eliminate Henselt, however, Geralt showed up in defense of the king and the former companions clashed. After a hard fought battle, Auckes was cut down by Geralt.[1]After his death, the sorcerer Dethmold used Hanmarvyn's Blue Dream on Geralt - a necromantic ritual that allows one to experience the final moments of the dead through someone else's eyes. After seeing the witcher's recent past, Geralt learned of the location of the Kingslayers' hideout and Síle de Tansarville's involvement in the assassinations of the northern monarchs.[1]Auckes in a heat of battle, using two swordsAuckes seemed to be the less serious of the brothers, being sarcastic at times while being very confident of his skills. Serrit noted that Auckes was something of an optimist, although he was not reckless; more so than Serrit, Auckes realised the potential difficulty of his task and was uncomfortable with the idea of facing Geralt. Along with his brother, Auckes was fond of using bear traps.Auckes appeared to regard Geralt as a friend, which is reflected when he asked if Geralt wasn't hanged for Foltest murder and Letho asked him if he wanted to see him hanged, he lowered his head and just answered ""no"". According to a Scoia'tael prisoner in the Kaedweni camp, Auckes was very proficient in Elder Speech, to a much greater extent than Geralt."

However, in Chapter IV, Geralt finds Berengar, still very much alive just outside of Murky Waters.Berengar and Geralt work together briefly, before Berengar explains why he left Kaer Morhen. He voices his disdain for the Witchers, whom he holds responsible for denying him a normal life. Later, on Black Tern Island, Berengar confronts Geralt with the intention of challenging him to a duel, forcing Geralt to choose once again, his next course of action.If he spares Berengar, then Geralt will have an ally to aid in the final battle with Azar Javed. If he duels with Berengar (as Geralt tells Berengar, just before the fight), only one can come out alive and Geralt prevails. This leaves Geralt with Berengar's remaining belongings, which include a powerful medallion, so powerful in fact, that Azar Javed cannot fail to notice it in the final battle.Note that when Azar Javed kills Berengar (if Geralt spared him earlier), the powerful medallion cannot be found on his corpse.It is actually possible to prevent Azar Javed from killing Berengar at the end of Chapter V, but nothing happens between Geralt and Berengar if this is the case. When the player clicks on Berengar, the witcher says: ""I needed time to think"" as a normal NPC would do, no choice dialogues appear.

However, he didn't truly get into poetry until he was 19, after being inspired by his love for Countess de Stael.[4]Dandelion studied the seven liberal arts for four years at Oxenfurt University before later becoming a professor, but only taught students for a year before leaving the academy to travel the world. He would, however, visit Oxenfurt from time to time to give guest lectures.Within a very few years he gained worldwide fame and became known as one of the best minstrels in the Northern Kingdoms, with his best known song was the Ballad of the Lion Cub of Cintra.Dandelion first met Geralt at a fête in the town of Gulet in Aedirn. There, the poet had knocked up a girl under the musician's podium, and her four sturdy brothers were looking for him all over town, threatening to geld him and cover him in pitch and sawdust.The so called Valley of Flowers seemed just right the right location for the duo's swift escape, as it was supposed to be the edge of the inhabited world, the last outpost of civilization. It was in the small town of Upper Posada, located in a part of the Northern Realms that later became Dol Blathanna, that the pair had their first adventure together, involving a nasty Sylvan and an encounter with Dol Blathanna's native inhabitants, the Elves. During this adventure, Dandelion received his priceless lute from Toruviel.[5]Later, Dandelion was in Vizima and heard word of Geralt being injured and recovering at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander. He visited the temple and spoke to Nenneke, trying to win her favour, despite her annoyance of him flirting with one of the priestesses.After, he went and saw Geralt and the two spent time discussing Dandelion's education, as well as the lack of work for the witcher. Later that day, the two left for the city of Ellander. Once they arrived in the city, they were confronted by Dennis Cranmer, Arthur Tailles and Count Falwick, and Geralt was forced to duel Tailles. After the conflict the witcher and the bard returned to the temple and said their goodbyes before leaving.At some point Dandelion offered his services to the Redanian Secret Service, though it seemed his loyalty was dubious at the least, as he also collaborated with Temerian agents and special forces.During his travels with Geralt, Dandelion started to write his memoirs, entitled ""Half a Century of Poetry""; twice, in fact. His first attempt was lost in the bottom of the duchess of Toussaint's closet after the poet was banished from her duchy. But rather than bemoaning that loss, the poet decided to rewrite his memoirs from scratch. His poems were later bound in two collections: The Adversities of Loving and Time of the Moon.Dandelion was contacted by Ciri for aid in fixing a phylactery, which could either be used to cast or lift a curse; Ciri kept her objective to herself and Dandelion was unwilling to pry any further. Unfortunately, with mage hunts going on in Novigrad, Dandelion decided to turn to Whoreson Junior, a member of the Big Four crime lords of Novigrad. Junior agreed to find someone to repair the phylactery but for a steep price: he wanted Dandelion to steal Sigi Reuven's treasure and who was another Big Four.Dandelion eventually conjured up a plan with the help of Dudu and Kalkstein and while he succeeded in getting the treasure, the commander of the Temple Guard, Caleb Menge, found out and took the treasure for himself. Believing the bard had betrayed him, Whoreson Junior's men chased Dandelion and Ciri all the way to Temple Isle. Ciri manged to barely escape from being killed by teleporting away, but Dandelion was unfortunately captured by Menge's men and was jailed while Menge waited to publically execute the bard on Oxenfurt.In the game, Dandelion is an avid dice poker player, a sharper rank. From Chapter III onward, Geralt can play him for the sheer pleasure of the game and orens, but officially, it is only in Chapter IV that he can play the bard as part of the Sharper quest.Dandelion first appears in Flotsam as he's about to be hanged at the main square for debauchery and burning down one of Flotsam's buildings. Geralt, Triss, and Vernon Roche (for whom Dandelion has secretly been working as a spy) come across this scene and deal with the problem."
"199","Demavend III","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Demavend III also spelled Demawend or in Elder Speech Demaewn, was the son of Virfuril who succeeded his father as the 16th King of Aedirn. He had one legitimate son and heir, Stennis.[3]Much of his reign was marked by a centuries-old dispute with Kaedwen, ruled at the time by King Henselt, over the fertile land of Upper Aedirn. Apart from that, Demavend fought in both the First and Second Northern Wars against the invading Nilfgaardian Empire. After the second war, he was one of the negotiators of the peace treaty.Demavend wasn't very trustful of mages, calling them ""devious old windbags"", and preferred royal messengers for communication. He nonetheless had Radcliffe of Oxenfurt as an advisor and informant, and also called Yennefer for help from time to time.At some point in 1226, agents of Temerian Secret Service who infiltrated Aedirnian Special Forces stationed in Aldersberg made an attempt on the life of underage Prince Demavend, an act meant to be Medell's revenge for the shameful defeat Virfuril handed him near Hagge. Although it was unsuccessful, Virfuril flew into a rage and executed an entire third of the special forces including the Commissar Vilmerik Moebius.[6]In 1263, upon learning about the atrocities perpetrated by the Black Forces in Cintra, Demavend joined the rest of the Four Kingdoms with his army to avenge Calanthe and drive the invaders back. Led by Vizimir II of Redania, the united forces of the North managed to defeat Nilfgaard in the battle of Sodden Hill. A truce was negotiated shortly after the battle, which Demavend signed.This concord among the North's great powers disappeared just as soon as Nilfgaard retreated. Demavend and Henselt renewed their quarrel over the Upper Aedirn which, however, they stopped in spring 1267 when Demavend summoned Henselt along with Vizimir II, Foltest of Temeria and his staunchest ally Meve of Lyria and Rivia to Hagge.Demavend (third from right) deliberating with Vizimir II, Meve, Henselt, and Foltest at HaggeIn the beginning, Demavend corrected Henselt it wouldn't be sergeants but young officers who were going to lead Nilfgaard's armies in wars to come, following Emhyr var Emreis' military purges. Later, when they discussed the spreading of a pro-Nilfgaard prophecy in the North, Demavend revealed he once had a cleric tortured to find out how much Emhyr paid him but the cleric expired before revealing a thing. This prompted Vizimir II to warn him against such methods to avoid making martyrs. He also eagerly agreed with a major campaign to root out Scoia'tael and momentarily considered a punitive expedition to Dol Blathanna.As the monarchs agreed Cintra should be conquered back, Demavend proposed for it to be a joint protectorate but was persuaded it should be a free country once more. He quickly guessed that the mysterious force searching for the lost heir of Cintra, Ciri, was Emhyr who wanted her to legalize his conquest. Another proposition he came up with afterward was a morganatic marriage of Ciri to Vissegerd as a puppet king, but this was turned down by others present. In order to get ahead of Emhyr, the kings eventually silently agreed that the Cintran heir had to die.[7]Right after the summit, Demavend began the war preparations. He launched a large-scale persecution of nonhumans and an offensive against Scoia'tael simultaneously with Henselt in order clear the rear before striking Nilfgaard. Teaming up with Meve, Demavend redistributed around third of his men into forts along the southern frontier, as close to the enemy as possible. The plan was to provoke Nilfgaardian rangers stationed in Dol Angra to attack Lyrians or Aedirnians who could then call it a casus belli, cross Yaruga in full force and call others for help.By June, Demavend began to send messengers to Foltest and Vizimir II, informing them soldiers disguised as Nilfgaardians were ready for second July night. Foltest replied first, asking Demavend to withhold until the mages' assembly was over. Vizimir then wanted the same, adding what the Redanian Secret Service found out – that there has been a betrayal, Emhyr knew about the plan and moved a massive army under Menno Coehoorn to Dol Angra. Alas, the reply never reached Demavend as the messenger was shot by Yaevinn in the woods of the Pontar Valley.On a night from 1 to 2 July, Nilfgaardian force disguised as Lyrians and Aedirnians seized Glevitzingen, an Imperial border post. Mere moments after, a group of Demavend's heralds escorted by Lyrian soldiers – all of whom were quite possibly still disguised Black Ones – informed the folk of the surrounding villages that Aedirn was taking control now. Claiming this an act of aggression, the Imperials crossed the Yaruga immediately, conquering the Lyrian border fortresses Scala and Spalla in just three days. Rivia was prepared for months of siege but capitulated under the promise of no harm. As Nilfgaard captured her realm, Meve retreated to Aedirn, seeking aid.When she found him, Demavend was participating in the battle of Aldersberg.[8]Unbeknownst to most, he was carrying out an affair with a local prostitute Demaretta which resulted in an illegitimate son named Baldwin. Demavend and his forces fell back to the Old City where the prostitute was going into labor. With Meve and the remnant of her army, they held out until Demavend's child was born, retreating from the city right after. When the battle ended, Demavend gave Meve a few of his men to help her in a guerilla war and then bid her farewell.[5]Seeing his army annihilated, the kingdom in ashes and betrayal from Henselt who struck a deal with Nilfgaard and robbed him of Lormark, Demavend sought asylum in Tretogor,[8] where the Regency Council hosted him.[9] When Nilfgaard reached the defenseless Vengerberg they had no mercy, burning it entirely to the ground.[10]Demavend did not waste time in Redania but worked hard to gather as many soldiers as possible to reclaim his dominion. When in March 1268 the decisive battle of Brenna commenced, Demavend sent some of his units in support. As the battle turned victorious for the Noth, Demavend and Henselt met on Aedirnian soil, shook hands and agreed to advance against Ardal aep Dahy, the commander of Nilfgaardian East Army Group, together. Strengthened by Redanian reinforcements and Meve's guerillas, who had cruelly sacked Nilfgaard's rear, the allied kings not only stopped Ardal's advance but drove him all the way to Aldersberg. Without any delay, Demavend and Henselt routed his army in a final battle and won, despite Nilfgaard having a significant numerical advantage.Since Foltest had similar success with driving Nilfgaard south past Angren, Nilfgaard started to sue for peace. Meeting at the end of the March in Cintra, the Northern kings negotiated with Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen who represented the Emperor. To avoid unwanted complications with Nilfgaard and unnecessary bloodshed, Demavend agreed to accept Dol Blathanna as an autonomous elven duchy. Aedirnian control of Hagge, occupied by Foltest for safety reasons since late July last year, was also restored. Only Henselt refused to return the Upper Aedirn as he claimed it was an ethnic territory of Kaedwen. In the end, his court sorcerer Sabrina Glevissig pressed him into withdrawing from conquered castles in less than a week. The treaty's final version was signed on 2 April.To celebrate the end of the war, a great celebration was held in Novigrad which Demavend attended.[11]It took but one year before the Kaedwenian Army attempted to retake the Upper Aedirn. They crossed Pontar on a third day after the Velen equinox without any formal declaration of war to have an element of surprise. Demavend, however, had good spies, so he was ready for them. He lined up his troops consisting of banners from Vengerberg, Aldersberg, Gulet and a dwarven regiment from Vergen along the hills near and gave their command to his champion Seltkirk who was a great inspiration to fighting Aedirnians. They numbered more than 5,000.As the battle started, Aedirnians quickly decimated the Dun Banner and wreaked havoc among the Kaedwenians but the battle later turned into a veritable hell after Sabrina Glevissig conjured Melgar's Fire, killing Aedirnians and Kaedwenians alike. Henselt then ordered Sabrina to be burned alive at the stake and retreated back to his kingdom.In 1271, while out on one of his ships celebrating with various entertainment, the witcher Letho secretly boarded and, using a Northern Wind-based special capsule, froze the majority of the ship and its people in place, though a mage on board managed to protect the king and a few other guards. However, none of them could best the witcher, who proceeded to cut them all down before grabbing Demavend and killing him, then cut off his head as proof.[3]Despite apparently having a belly large enough to hold a tankard full of beer while he was sprawled in his armchair,[7] Demavend was still considered a handsome man by 1268.[11]He was especially attractive in his younger years and it was said that Foltest himself would've envied his eagle-like profile with piercing emerald-green eyes. Demavend also had a rather lustrous mane that, to his great sorrow, receded quickly with age. To hide this he often wore a white cap embroidered with golden thread.[1]Demavend was intelligent, well-educated and knowledgeable about tactics. This is best evidenced by how he was able to predict Emhyr's moves during the Northern Wars.[7] A shrewd, farseeing politician, he knew precisely what to do to ensure the integrity of his realm. One of his other characteristic traits was self-control. Demavend was able to maintain calm façade even when arguing with impulsive people like Henselt. Only his face betrayed how much effort he put into not losing composure.[11]He was cruel at times, ordering priests whose preachings interfered with his politics to be tortured to death. His hatred for elves was legendary and he went as far as launching a large persecution of nonhumans that resulted in many a pogrom.[7] What's more, Demavend offered 50 ducats for every Scoia'tael head, even in a time when the royal treasury was nearly drained by the war with Nilfgaard.[1] It must be said, though, that he didn't hate the nonhumans blindly. He had good relations with dwarves of Mahakam and eventually allowed Dol Blathanna to be an autonomous elven duchy.[11]Demavend is a leader in the Homecoming version."

His brother, Drithelm, was in the service of King Esterad of Kovir.Compared to other mages, Dethmold had a surprisingly pleasant attitude. He could be courteous and friendly, although he likely had ulterior motives for being nice. This could have also been a ploy to make himself appear as less of a threat to others. Despite his friendly projection, his appearance and attire have been known to terrify several people.[1]Later on, he revealed he was at least partially sadistic, delighting in the torture of prisoners and had brutally killed and mutilated victims with magic. He also had no qualms with performing necromancy, a banned form of magic.Dethmold is a main character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. He was the mage advisor to King Henselt and featured heavily in the plot if Geralt allied himself with Vernon Roche. His hair color was not apparent in the game, if he even had any left. Dethmold was amoral and would do anything to gain power for himself and/or Kaedwen, including kidnapping Anais La Valette if Geralt did not join Iorveth in Chapter I.Dethmold had no scruples when it came to kidnapping, execution or other socially frowned upon actions. He had a non-existent morality - and this carried on to his advisee, Henselt of Kaedwen. He was however also loyal to not only Henselt but Kaedwen as a nation.As revealed during Chapter III on Roche's path, Dethmold was also homosexual. He was seen with his manservant who was also his sex slave (though it is not proven besides the words of the servant himself) while preening in front of a vanity, gently caressing his acne, warts and zits. There were a number of suggestive items scattered around his chambers in Loc Muinne. Dethmold also had an apprentice and a little commando for his safeguard.On Roche's path, depending on the circumstances, Dethmold could either slip through Geralt's grasp or he could be brutally killed by Roche. On Iorveth's path he would be executed on Saskia's orders.Comments about Dethmold from the CDPR developers Jan Bartkowicz (Story Writer), Artur Sliwinski, (Story Writer), Arkadiusz Borowik (Story Writer) and Jan Marek (Concept Artist) taken from the ""Dev Diary 3:"

"212","Eredin Bréacc Glas","Elf (Aen Elle)","Male",NA," Wild Hunt","Pale blue (games)Eredin Bréacc Glas, also dubbed Sparrowhawk by the unicorns, was an Aen Elle elf and commander of an elven cavalry known as the Wild Hunt. As its leader, he was known to most as the King of the Wild Hunt. Eredin was a high ranking general in his world until he killed the king and became his successor.Despite being a notable strong soldier who was also skilled in magic, not much was known about his younger years.When King Auberon Muircetach, ruler of the Aen Elle elves, created the Red Riders, he appointed Eredin as their leader and general. Eredin, who at the time could access the Gate of the Worlds, allowing him to travel to different worlds at will, used the Gate and led the Red Riders in raiding many different worlds. Their main objective was to find and secure a sufficient number of humanoid - preferably human - slaves, that could serve the elves. Over time, this made Eredin and his men infamous and feared and they began to use magic to make themselves look even more menacing, like skeleton shaped armor and altering their voices.As time went on, they eventually rediscovered their original homeworld: the Aen Seidhe world where, prior to the Conjunction of the Spheres, all elves were from. However, it was now controlled by humans and since the Aen Elle had a deep hatred towards the race, the Aen Seidhe world became their primary target with Eredin often leading raids on the world and stealing a great number of young individuals. People from that world quickly started to fear the riders and they gave them a new name - the Wild Hunt. Because Eredin always led his men personally, he was present almost all the time and, as the lead rider, he caused the most fear in the common folk and soon they started to call him the King of the Wild Hunt.An unknown time later, the unicorns freed themselves from the grasp of the Aen Elle and took the Gate from them, meaning Eredin could no longer use it. This also caused all the elves to be stuck in their world with no access to more slaves and so they began to study the magic of traveling to different realms. However, they were only partially successful and created navigators - specialized mages trained to open portals to different worlds, but they could only transport a small group of riders. Due to this, the riders used spectral forms in place of physical and traveled in the skies as a cavalcade of specters.Around 1267 the Wild Hunt sensed a certain individual with very powerful Elder blood who turned out to be a little girl named Cirilla. As Elder blood was crucial for regaining access to the Gate of the Worlds, Eredin set his sights on capturing her as he wanted to resume his invasions of other realms. The Wild Hunt first tried to catch her near the city of Gors Velen but this failed and his continued search for her proved fruitless. However, thanks to his fellow elf Avallac'h, who lured Ciri to the Aen Elle world and took her to the palace in Tir ná Lia, Eredin was finally able to confront her and the two elves gave her an ultimatum: either she lay with the king and give him a child that would reintroduce the Elder blood to the elves - thus possibly giving them access to the Gate again - or she would never leave the palace. Ciri eventually agreed and tried to fulfill her end of the bargain but Auberon was very old and hated humans, considering them little more than animals. Because of this, he was unable to perform and produce a child with Ciri. Eredin, sensing an opportunity, gave an aphrodisiac to his king that was actually a poison, killing Auberon. This, in turn, made Eredin the successor to the crown.With the king dead, chaos spread in the palace and Ciri, with the help of the unicorns, managed to escape not only the palace but the Aen Elle world altogether. Eredin pursued her with the Wild Hunt but she managed to evade them and so he returned to the palace empty handed.Once he returned, he proclaimed himself the new king, having made sure nobody knew about his role in Auberon's death. Only Avallac'h suspected Eredin, but he had no proof so he left the palace and went searching for Ciri on his own.Meanwhile, Eredin consolidated his power and made a few changes. Because he had no interest in the governing aspects that come with being a king, he appointed Ge'els to serve as his viceroy and take care of the state while he was leading the Wild Hunt. He also chose two elves as his most trusted generals - Caranthir as a chief navigator and Imlerith as a commander of the riders.He also haunted Ciri as a wraith while she rested in a French tavern, telling her that he would wait for her on The Spiral - a place he said she would eventually enter after her long journey through space and time.The Aen Elle world soon faced a new and dangerous threat known as the White Frost - a deadly phenomenon that caused an eternal winter, killing off everything that once inhabited the world, and was supposed to be the eventual end of every known world. Eredin decided the only way to escape the apocalypse would be to move the Aen Elle to the world of the Aen Seidhe and conquer it. However, his navigators lacked the power to move thousands of Aen Elle elves. Knowing Ciri's power would be able to create a large enough portal for his people, even if it were to kill her in the process, thus Eredin began to hunt for Ciri once more.This time however he tried something new. He knew that Ciri had loved ones so his new approach was to capture them and hopefully lure her into a trap while she attempted to save them. Thus he and his raiders went to Malus Island where Ciri's adoptive parents - Geralt of Rivia and Yennefer of Vengerberg - lived. Though Geralt managed to cut down many of the attackers, Eredin was able to kidnap the sorceress and took off with her. Geralt pursued him and was joined at one point by several witchers from the School of the Viper and, together, they caught up with the Hunt near the Hanged Man's tree in Nilfgaard and began to fight the Hunt. While the witchers proved to be capable fighters, they were too outnumbered, so Geralt offered to take Yennefer's place and Eredin agreed, releasing Yennefer.For some time, the witcher rode with the Wild Hunt and Eredin was satisfied as Geralt was an excellent lure for Ciri. As expected, she soon found out and in 1270 she managed to save Geralt from Eredin's grasp while not getting caught herself. Despite this, Eredin continued to haunt Geralt using his spectral form and eventually the two had a confrontation (with Eredin still in his spectral form) before he re-focused his efforts on Ciri, who by that point was being helped by Avallac'h.Eredin and the Hunt pursued the duo for over a year until one day the pair teleported to Ard Skellig. Sensing the power that came from such a teleportation, Eredin ambushed them in the forest and managed to inflict an extremely powerful Aen Undod curse upon Avallac'h that would slowly transformer the sage into a diminutive creature that humans would later call Uma. However, Avallac'h was not one to go down easily and cast a powerful spell that wrought havoc in the Hunt's ranks, destroying much of the forest, allowing the duo to escape, albeit ending up in different regions. Ciri ended up in Velen where she lost conscious and the Crones found her. However, the Crones served Eredin and when he was informed they had Ciri, he sent Imlerith to retrieve her. However, Ciri had managed to wake up and learn what the Crones had planned and escaped once more.Sometime later she returned to Skellige, this time to the village of Hindarsfjall, but not even a day later the Hunt attacked again. One of the locals, Skjall, helped her escape to where Avallac'h was waiting for her with Eredin and the Hunt hot on their heels, but the two made out into the water, leaving their pursuers on shore.With Ciri's location now unknown, Eredin waited for another chance Ciri might use her ability, giving her location away once more. Eventually Geralt, who learned Avallac'h had hidden her on the Isle of Mists, recovered her and the Hunt appeared, forcing Ciri to use her teleportation to transport her and Geralt to Kaer Morhen.Now knowing the location of Ciri, the Wild Hunt attacked the witcher keep in full force and Imlerith and Caranthir personally took part in the fight, but Eredin watched rather than join in himself. However, the witchers were able to put up a tougher fight than expected and Eredin called his generals away before blasting through into the courtyard with a powerful frost spell, freezing everyone caught in the blast, including Geralt.Ciri and Vesemir, who'd been shielded by a wall, were the only ones not affected and while the old witcher tried his best to get Ciri to safety, he was caught by Imlerith who began to beat him up when Eredin stopped him, realizing they could use his life as blackmail to get Ciri to go with them. Despite Vesemir's protests to not do it, Ciri started to walk unarmed towards Eredin so Vesemir stabbed Imlerith who angrily snapped the witcher's neck. Seeing the death of her old mentor, Ciri's grief and rage, mixed with her Elder blood, caused a burst of raw magical power, threatening to kill not just the Wild Hunt and Eredin, but all the witchers in the area as well. Eredin, driven by the need to capture Ciri regardless, tried in vain to get to her, but Caranthir opened a portal and teleported himself and the king away, ending the battle.In the days following Eredin's humiliating retreat, the Aen Elle king received a few devastating blows to his power base, starting with Imlerith being slain by Geralt at the Sabbath before the White Wolf and Avallac'h traveled to Tir ná Lia to show Ge'els via onieromancy of Eredin's regicide, which prompted the viceroy to refuse reinforcements should Eredin call for aid.Eventually, Eredin responded to a call from Ciri using the Sunstone, prompting him to redirect the Naglfar to the coast of Undvik. He soon found that it was in fact a trap, as the Wild Hunt was beset by both Nilfgaardians and Skelligers. On the deck of his ship, Eredin faced Crach an Craite and the elf proceeded to toy with the jarl, dealing him grievous wounds before asking if he had any final words. Crach refused and went in for one last attack, which Eredin cut down with ease, killing the jarl.He was then confronted by Geralt and Eredin proclaimed he had something to tell the witcher but would only reveal it as the witcher was dying. As they battled, Eredin opened various portals into other realms where the two continued to fight before returning back to the Naglfar and where Geralt proceeded to stab Eredin in his left eye before dealing a fatal blow. Dying, Eredin confessed that Avallac'h had manipulated both of them into this confrontation so he could use Ciri for his own purposes before succumbing to his wounds.Eredin Bréacc Glas is one of playable characters in MOBA ""The Witcher Battle Arena"" added with Season 3 Update and has a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins. He is a warrior class hero.Eredin pursues Ciri across the main regions of third installment, aided by two of his generals: Imlerith and Caranthir.Eredin has led the Hunt's riders for dozens, possibly even hundreds, of years. In order to inspire greater terror, he wears armor making him look like a ghastly wraith. Elements of it are enameled in red and shaped so as to resemble a body whose skin has been flayed off. Crowning the armor is a skull-shaped helmet made of black steel, heavy, spiked brassards and greaves, and an openwork breastplate shaped to resemble skeletal ribs. Galloping on his mount, sword raised in the air, Eredin seems to most mortal men the incarnation of their worst possible nightmare.Very few are aware of the fact, but underneath the King of the Wild Hunt's ghastly armor lies a being made of flesh and blood. The Riders of the Wild Hunt are in truth not wraiths, but warriors of the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk, distant relatives of the Aen Seidhe, the elves inhabiting the world in which our tale takes place.Beneath he helmet of the King himself lies the face of Eredin, ruler and general of the Aen Elle. His face is slim and attractive, though clearly marked by cold cruelty. Dark, deep-set eyes, aristocratic features, a pale complexion, and thin lips twisted into a slight grimace complete our main antagonist's appearance. ...In the world of the Aen Elle, Eredin Bréacc Glas once led an elite cavalry unit known as Dearg Ruadhri, meaning the Red Riders in Elder Speech. It was this unit that constituted the initial core of the Wild Hunt, and eilt formation able to move between worlds. The initial number of Dearg Ruadhri is not known, yet one can confidently assume that it rose greatly after Eredin ascended the throne after the death of his predecessor, King Auberon. These skilled Aen Elle warriors are foes that Geralt will have to face many times in this installment of the series. There are also five leader cards with Eredin's name as leader of Monsters Gwent deck. Four of which are in base game, while fifth one comes with Hearts of Stone expansion."
"213","Eskel","Human (witcher)","Male","Witcher"," School of the Wolf","Eskel was a witcher of the School of the Wolf taught by Master Vesemir at Kaer Morhen and active in the 13th century. As the sorceress Triss Merigold noticed, Eskel emanated a strong magic aura. Though less famous than his peer Geralt of Rivia, Eskel became renowned in his own right as a professional, reliable witcher, and possessing a kind and relaxed disposition.Eskel and the White Wolf were like brothers. Side by side they grew up, enjoyed pastime activities and endured the witcher trials. A good friend of younger Lambert and Coën of Poviss, Eskel saw Vesemir as both a mentor and a father figure. He returned to Kaer Morhen each winter to swap tales and rejuvenate for The Path.Born in mountains, Eskel originated from hill-folk. His mother used to sing him an old hiking tune about a hen, which would later be the only thing the witcher remembered of her.[1]Under unknown circumstances, The Witchers' Settlement in the Blue Mountains eventually became his home. He befriended Geralt, a peer who gradually turned into his almost-brother. Together they relished in childish delinquencies. Once, Eskel and Geralt had captured a huge forest bumblebee and tied it to a jug. Watching its antics, the two had fits of laughter until Vesemir had caught and punished them with a leather strap.[2]Tirelessly studying all sorts of creatures, trainees got to hear teachers repeat jokes about virgins and unicorns or basilisks and mirrors, quickly finding all unamusing. The one they found most primitive—infinite versions of how a young witcher shook his hand with a female dragon.[3] To become full-fledged witchers, the youth had undergone murderous and painful Changes together, the Trial of the Grasses which changed their physiology, granting them, among other things, cat-like vision in the dark. Young Eskel feared for his friend's life when Geralt's hair turned white as a side effect of the Trial, though both managed to beat the odds and survive it together. They trained on The Trail. Leading around the Kaer Morhen through dangerous obstacles, it was generally known as ""The Killer"".[4]Eskel propped by Lambert, moments after receiving distorting scars.In the late 1210s, Eskel saved a prince of Caingorn in a dire struggle with a werebbubb gang and was offered anything he wanted as a reward. Given such a wide-open choice, he could not think of anything and instead recited the fabled Law of Surprise ""give me that which you find at home yet do not expect"" that he had heard Vesemir repeat over the years.This is how Princess Deidre Ademeyn born during an eclipse became his surprise child. Avoiding responsibility, Eskel took great pains to evade going back. Taking ridiculously long routes to avoid the proximity of Caingorn, he had heard about Deidre maturing into a highly unpredictable lass. Plus she discovered an innate gift of obstructing magic in her area, all superstitiously interpreted as ""accursed mutations of the Black Sun"". To determine what it all meant, Eskel carried a collective work about the phenomenon. He surmised the Council of Wizards meddled too much into state affairs, botched it and, had they not sent Sabrina Glevissig, Ademeyn might not have become ostracized.When she sought asylum around 1242,[N 2] Vesemir hosted her and Eskel busied himself with a kikimore hatchery in the old mine outside Kaer Morhen while devising a solution and where Geralt found him and the two discussed the situation. In a way, Eskel cared and didn't want to pass her to Glevissig who, bursting with unproven conclusions, wished to kill and study Ademeyn. After heading back, Vesemir called his pupils to present ideas. Eskel, unsure, asked Geralt for guidance.If the witchers chose not to help Deidre: The witchers decided not to help her, and Deidre went into a rage, almost fatally attacking Eskel before fleeing, with Sabrina stepping in to heal Eskel's wounds, though unable to remove his deep facial scars. She requested the witchers leave it for her to find and deal with Deidre. It is unknown if the witchers allowed this, but for the next two years, the notorious and murderous outlaw Deidre terrorized southern Kaedwen. Eventually she was hunted down and killed, either by Sabrina and her allies or a mysterious man with a terribly scarred face who refused to collect the bounty that had accumulated on her.If the witchers chose to help her: A scuffle between Ademeyn and her younger brother Merwin Ademeyn, Glevissig's misguided ally poised to rule, caught Eskel inside. Accidentally, the princess slashed the witcher across his face, but deeply regretting it, she subsequently left, resolving the entire matter. Several years later she sent him a letter with her royal seal upon it, but Eskel put it into a fire without reading it and never spoke of her again.Though the witchers of Kaer Morhen never spoke of her again, none of them forgot her either, each carrying her memory in their heart.[5]Early autumn 1264 had seen Eskel return again for the winter. A certain day, he went to close the main gate to stop heat from escaping when Geralt brought Ciri. Eskel embraced the Wolf and though he was skeptical at first, he nonetheless agreed with Ciri's training. He welcomed the girl at Kaer Morhen and took her luggage. Asked who else was inside besides Vesemir, Eskel responded with the names of Lambert and Coën, their mate[4] from the School of the Griffin.[6] Following months, Eskel helped Ciri train. He was worried, however, by her trances induced by an accidental sip of White Gull.[4]The third trance scared the witchers most, so they sat down. Eskel, who couldn't withstand the silence, swore and stood up to bring a bottle of something strong. Listening to Coën and Geralt, he took a vodka. Vesemir was furious about the booze in the beginning but later beckoned Eskel to pour him a pint. After more silence, Eskel came up with an idea to summon a witch. When Lambert mocked Ciri's latest prophecy by stating witchers are likely to die by monster teeth, he added dental gangrene may be another interpretation, seemingly serious. Vesemir hushed both, saying they shouldn't joke about it.[3]They decided to call Triss Merigold who arrived near Midinváerne of 1265. The sorceress noticed Eskel emanated potent magic when he bowed and politely took her hand to kiss it. Initially suspicious she could be poised to reveal witchers' secrets to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, Merigold convinced Eskel of having no such intention. He had a good relationship with Merigold altogether. When she had comments on how witchers treat Ciri, he listened. After determining what to do about Ciri, Merigold told the witchers about the situation in the Northern Kingdoms. Early on, Eskel asked several questions but ceased to as it turned into a dispute about neutrality.[4]Eskel wintering at the keep.Before 1267, Yennefer of Vengerberg visited Kaer Morhen and Eskel met her.[4] As the Second Northern War had neared its end, Eskel was in the vicinity of Brenna. After the massive battle of Brenna, he asked about Coën, who had fought for the North. Not only did he learn the jolly friend's fate, but Eskel retrieved a silver sword once held by Coën,[6] though not the one he had at Brenna.[7] The sword retrieved would then be displayed in the main hall of Kaer Morhen.[6]He never gained Geralt's renown, even though he equaled the White Wolf in experience and skill. Despite that, Eskel has made a name for himself as an efficient witcher, learned in his trade. One of his recognized heroics was when he saved a little girl from a basilisk, splitting it down the stomach and getting her out. He wasn't paid due to the fact he was wandering those lands hunting zeugl. He didn't avoid adventures either, as he had slept with a succubus and took fisstech with her.[1] During warmer times at Kaer Morhen, Eskel would go out to drive back harpies.[8]Eskel during the Salamandra heist.One day before Belleteyn of 1270, Eskel and Lambert were both at Kaer Morhen and were supposed to repair one staircase, which they postponed. A day later, Eskel and Vesemir were out hunting in the woods and found the unconscious Geralt, till then considered dead, not far from the keep. They loaded him on a cart and while his friend laid exhausted, Eskel explained how nobody knew where he disappeared following the Rivian Pogrom. Reassuring amnesiac Geralt that all would be well, they brought him to Lambert and Triss Merigold back at the keep.Shortly thereafter, Azar Javed and the mysterious Salamandra struck. Eskel, like all his comrades, defended the keep. Splitting, Vesemir assigned Eskel and Lambert to help him battle Savolla's frightener. Nevertheless, the thugs got the upper hand. Witchers retreated into the upper courtyard, where Merigold blamed Eskel and Lambert for not repairing that staircase as it could have helped the defense. When she also said Salamandra may be there for witcher mutagens, Lambert was skeptical but Eskel supported her. Though he helped slay the frightener, the bandits got away with the mutagens.After they burned the murdered trainee Leo on a funeral pyre, the witchers split up to seek information. Eskel took western direction as he had contacts there and preferred coast climate. Before leaving, Eskel gave Geralt valuable advice on fencing and alchemy.[7]Executing a forktail.Through the year that followed the defeat of the mastermind behind Salamandra, Jacques de Aldersberg, Eskel had several contracts. He pierced a fogler, fought a red-skinned insectoid or flamed four wraiths.[9] Next, he had been hired to deal with a hypnotic samovila but left after the peasant who paid fell in love with her.On a search for a katakan more than a century old and liable to kill drunkards, Eskel had to stalk the opponent for a month before dealing the final blow. Including trying to trap it a masquerade ball held by the nobles to attract the vampire, during which he took the time to enjoy the company of a number of the ladies there. He eventually managed to trick it into drinking blood from a woman he paid to be heavily intoxicated with substances that would weaken it. After that he managed to kill it with ease and took its carcass back to Kaer Morhen with him. Proper examination of the vampire's body parts, he believed, could lead to discovering a new witcher method of age determination based on footsteps.[1]Eskel was out pursuing a forktail in the fall of 1272 as the draconid needed to be removed and Yennefer lacked organs to distill ingredients required to disenchant Uma. After Geralt tracked Eskel down, Eskel agreed to let the White Wolf join the hunt and the two talked about recent events going on in their lives before tracking and following the forktail to its lair and finishing it off. Then Eskel mounted his horse and the two made their way back to the keep with a friendly horse race.Inside, Eskel showed Geralt the katakan specimen and began its autopsy. Later on, as Yennefer started the transformation process on Uma, Eskel was noticeably troubled by Uma being put through the Trial of the Grasses and eventually walked off from it. Though he did return and brought some rags to help clean the floor, and Yennefer after she prompted him, as Uma had vomited on her during the Trial. After Yennefer broke Uma's curse and went to rest, Eskel sat with Lambert to share anecdotes and drink when Geralt joined them.Eskel goes toe to toe with Caranthir.As Eredin Bréacc Glas realized Ciri was on Kaer Morhen, he attacked and Eskel partook in the ensuing battle. He defended the inner courtyard of the keep. After Caranthir opened a portal and brought a few riders of the Wild Hunt through, Eskel dueled Caranthir, holding his own expertly, until Caranthir utiilized his teleporting, which almost cost him his life. Luckily, this did not happen as fate smiled upon him—Ciri saved his hide. Caranthir retreated after being called away, but not before he ordered his troops to kill the two. Eskel and Ciri then killed the warriors and continued to fend off the Hunt.Suddenly, icy coldness tore through holes opened by the Wild Hunt, freezing Eskel in motion. He only unfroze after Eredin and the Aen Elle warriors vanished, ousted by Ciri's outbreak of power in the wake of Vesemir's death.[1]In the battle's aftermath, Eskel bid a last farewell to his valiant master. Unable to imagine Kaer Morhen without Vesemir, he decided to watch over the Witchers' Settlement until winter 1273 and return to the Path for an unknown amount of time. Direction—Lormark. He supposed its warlike undertone would provide ample work opportunities.[1]In July 1267, Ciri experienced a pyromantic vision with a fraction of it showing Eskel and other witchers led onto a scaffold.[10] She had seen Eskel again in a different vision after entering Tor Zireael.[11] When recounting the story about Yennefer, Geralt and herself to Galahad, Ciri changed the end to a happy one, telling the naive knight from another world that, after the pogrom, a splendid feast took place with Eskel in attendance.[3]Elsewhere, bard Dandelion introduced a ballad Bitter, Evil Hearts, chronicling the tale of Eskel and Ademeyn.[5] A story about how Eskel saved the little girl from a Basilisk made it into A Few Remarks on Basilisks and Cockatrices, a book containing useful knowledge for beast hunters.[1] Decades on, by the 14th century, he had become a part of various iterations of the legend of the White Wolf and the witcher girl.[3]Eskel uses Igni against the Hunt.The Wolf witcher had a menacing, metallic voice that sounded like a dog's barking to Ciri when she first heard it. The most prominent feature of his visage was a long, hideous, semi-circular scar running from the corner of his mouth across the length of his cheek up to the ear. It got itchy when he was nervous or embarrassed. Minus the scar and hair color, Eskel and Geralt resembled one another like true brothers. Eskel's hands emanated powerfully with magic, with more power than the White Wolf's. This triggered pleasant, piercing vibration in mages.[4] On festive occasions, he would sport a beret adorned with pheasant feathers.[12]Eskel was calm, patient, stable, thoughtful and polite. Even when he disagreed wholeheartedly with a topic, he feigned politeness and interest in the matter. What betrayed him in such situations was avoiding eye contact. He enjoyed drinking and laughing with friends. Quite self-aware, he had no delusions about his appearance but that didn't hinder him from smiling. His fitting, mature behavior, especially when it came to Ciri compared to the other witchers endeared him to Triss Merigold.[4] Vesemir prized Eskel's reliability.[13]"

"220","Foltest","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Foltest was the king of Temeria, prince of Sodden, sovereign of Pontaria and Mahakam as well as the senior protector of Brugge and Ellander. He was the son of King Medell and Queen Sancia of Sodden, making him a member of the Temerian Dynasty.Sancia's royal connection with Sodden turned the principality into a vassal state and Ekkehard began paying tribute to Temeria after the death of Gutram. The king's Royal Council included the sorceresses Triss Merigold and Keira Metz, as well as Fercart of Cidaris, Willemer the priest, Bronibor and Hereward of Ellander.Foltest was a wise and handsome monarch. As with his predecessor, he was not fond of his grandfather, Hugo of Rivia. Upon his accession to the Temerian throne, he demanded that Hugo's portrait be removed from the throne room and had a habit of ""leaving Hugo out"" of the family genealogy. Foltest devoted plenty of time to lauding his great-grandfather, Griffin, as he was known to speak warmly of ""Grandmama Bienvenu"" and ""Great-grandmama Clarissa"". He tended to be highly evasive of any questions regarding family lineage.Although unmarried, many rumors about Foltest's romantic status circulated. From an early age, the then-prince created great scandal in the royal court by having an affair with his own sister, Adda. After ascending to the throne, he was to marry Adda and make her his queen, mortally offending King Vizimir II of Redania, who had arranged for Foltest to marry his daughter Dalimira. Adda died soon after the birth of their daughter, however, and the marriage never eventuated. The cursed child — possibly accursed by the courtier Ostrit, who was in love with Adda, but perhaps by Foltest's mother — died shortly after birth, or appeared to, until she emerged as a striga seven years later. The monster was so dangerous that Foltest was forced to move his residence elsewhere. The beast, however, remained a threat to all citizens living nearby. Foltest and his advisors at summoned a multitude of magical professionals or Knowing Ones. While most only offered a multitude of ways to kill the monster, one told of a possible ritual which could reverse the curse: sleeping within the Striga's sarcophagus till the third crowing of the cock. As no one at the time could succeed, Foltest kept the Striga alive while arbitrarily sending for mages and sorceress who might know how to reverse the spell.One day, the witcher Geralt of Rivia was taken before Foltest as he believed he could lift the curse on Adda. They discussed the contract and arranged a reward of 3,000 orens. Though they considered other options that Geralt could take, such as killing the striga, Foltest pleaded that Geralt simply cure it.Later Foltest went and visited Geralt, discussing three last matters: what process the witcher would go through to lift the curse, what he should do if he needs to defend his life, and what state Adda would be in if she survived. Geralt explained how he would lift the curse and then went on his way to Vizima and eventually succeeded.The affair between Foltest and his sister rendered him ineligible as a royal bachelor because any potential union would be tainted by the scandal. However, Foltest did not remain celibate for long. During the Second Northern War, he was secretly in love with the Baroness La Valette. It is widely rumored that both the Baroness' younger children, son Boussy and daughter Anaïs, are not the children of the old baron La Valette, but the progeny of Foltest. Adda the White is officially regarded as the successor to the Temerian throne, but the girl is clearly impaired and disabled.Foltest and King Demavend III of Aedirn joined forces to fight Nilfgaard in the second war, but Emperor Emhyr var Emreis was also prepared to fight and met their challenges blow for blow. Once the conflict came to a conclusion, he acted as one of the negotiators of the peace treaty of Cintra.In the original game, we hear about the king far in advance of any actual meeting. There is talk in the streets which suggests that the monarch is ""away"", but his specific location is never indicated. King Foltest only arrives in Chapter V, in the midst of the raging conflict in the streets of Old Vizima between the Scoia'tael and the Order of the Flaming Rose.Prior to this point, he was away and had left others to govern in his stead: Velerad for instance, and, as we find out later, Thaler.Journal entry imageHaving survived one assassination attempt at the hand of a mysterious killer thanks to the timely intervention of Geralt of Rivia, the king keeps Geralt nearby as he regards Geralt as a sort of ""good luck charm"". At the start of the game, Foltest is leading a civil war against the Baroness La Valette to claim his bastard children. He is eventually assassinated by the Kingslayer and Geralt is accused of the crime. One of Foltest's most trusted agents, Vernon Roche, assists Geralt in finding the Kingslayer. Leaving no lawful heirs, Foltest's assassination plunged Temeria into the chaos of interregnum. The threat of a full-blown civil war between the nobility and the last remaining bastard child and her supporters.In the game, Foltest has changed significantly, his clothes and face are completely different and is mostly focused on the design and art of the character - he appears more regal, colorful and distinctive. He only briefly appears (relative to the story) in the tutorial missions as flashbacks when recalling the events to Roche."

"224","Geralt of Rivia TV series Games","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher"," Wolf School","Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose ""Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde"", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so ""Geralt"" was all that remained of his chosen name. ""Of Rivia"" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title ""of Rivia"", which amused him.[1] He, therefore, became a true knight.Geralt was the son of the sorceress Visenna and, presumably, the warrior Korin, but when he was born Visenna left him with the School of the Wolf at Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was trained and made to be a witcher. He survived the many blistering mutations required to grant witchers their abilities and passed the Trial of the Grasses. Geralt's intensive training and the mutagenic experimentation carried out upon him, granted him considerably greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and extreme resistance to pain.Geralt was eventually put through the Trial of Forest Eyes, where he was left tied up in the woods and blindfolded and needed to return to the keep by the morning or he would fail. He was helped out of his binds by the elf Aideen, where they went to look at the non-human reservation to find the camp had been attacked by vrans. They then left and came across some Cat School witchers training and wrestling. Aideen then unbound Geralt and left him to return to his master.Later on, the Wolf School and the Cat School had a tournament between them, organized by King Radowit II who secretly plotted with the Cat School to kill the witchers from the Wolf School. In the first round, Geralt and Gweld faced off, slowly realizing while they were fighting that the whole tournament was a ruse. As they came to that realization however, a druid put a mind control spell upon Gweld which made him violently attack Geralt, forcing Geralt to kill his friend with a sword through the chest. Right after this, soldiers under Radowit's command surrounded the witchers and started to kill them all, but Geralt was able to escape on horseback, causing Radowit to put a bounty on his head.Geralt then came across Aideen again in the woods, who persuaded him not to kill the soldiers who slaughtered his fellow witchers, though he did kill one of Radowit's men that he saw along his trip back to Hertch, where he warned the elders about Radowit and the Cat School's betrayal.[2]Due to his brilliant success in training, Geralt was selected for additional mutation experiments. He was the only witcher to have survived these experiments, his stark white hair being a side effect of these additional mutations. After finishing his witcher training, Geralt set off into the world on a horse named Roach, a name he would bestow upon every one of his later horses. Thus, he became a monster slayer for hire.After about 50 miles after leaving Kaer Morhen, Geralt was anxious to kill his first monster. He came across a bald man with rotten teeth, alongside his mates, who were about to rape a young girl. The bald man prepared to rape her as his mates held back her father until Geralt came in and killed the bald man, which frightened the gang off. The young witcher expected thanks, though the reality of the situation soon set in: not only did the father flee with the gang, but the girl, with the bald man's blood on her, threw up, became hysterical, and then passed out when Geralt approached her.An unknown time later, he killed an amphisbaena and went to the court of King Idi of Kovir, where he handed in the head of the beast. However the king's mages, Zavist and Stregobor, told the king that Geralt was little more than a charlatan, so the king didn't pay the witcher anything and demanded he leave Kovir in 12 hours, which Geralt was barely able to do on account of the king's hourglass being broken.Two years later he made his way to Blaviken where the alderman, Caldemeyn, was happy to see the witcher after so many years since Geralt's last visit. While he couldn't offer a reward on a kikimore that Geralt killed nearby, his guards suggested the local mage, Irion, might have some use for it. However, when they arrived at the mage's tower, Geralt immediately saw Irion was actually none other than Stregobor. Once the witcher and mage were alone, the two discussed the past, with Geralt sardonically remarking on how Stregobor talked the former King Idi out of paying him back in Kovir. Pushing this aside, Stregobor revealed he needed Geralt's help: Renfri, a bandit and the leader of a gang, was in town looking to kill him, and therefore he wished for the witcher to kill Renfri. Unfazed by this, Geralt remarked it wasn't his problem and left.Later that night, Geralt and Caldemeyn went to The Golden Court, the town's inn and where Renfri was staying. Geralt found her gang sans leader, but none of them were very cooperative and just made jokes until one member, Fifteen, challenged him to a fight. However, before it could begin, Renfri appeared and went to talk to Geralt and Caldemeyn in private, with the latter demanding she leave town or be thrown in jail. Unperturbed, Renfri revealed a letter of safe conduct from King Audoen which gave her immunity in Hengfors and Arcsea and after another short discussion, Geralt and the alderman left.That night, as Geralt went to his guest room in Caldemeyn's home, he found Renfri there, who eventually revealed her entire past, including how Stregobor played a part in banishing the princess from her own kingdom on account of her being born during a black sun, setting into play a constant struggle between the two: her trying to kill the mage and the mage trying to kill her. She then asked Geralt to help her kill Stregobor, but the witcher once again refused to take sides. After telling her she should leave town, Renfri remarked on the Tridam ultimatum, before agreeing she'd leave the next day, but in the meantime wished to sleep with Geralt, who obliged.The next morning though, as Geralt ate breakfast with Caldemeyn and his family, the alderman revealed the deadly meaning behind the Tridam ultimatum, making Geralt realize Renfri's ruse was to take the market-goers hostage and he ran off to the market, which was preparing for its busiest day of the year. When he arrived, he found Renfri's gang, who hadn't acted yet as Renfri went off to give Stregobor the ultimatum first. Not wanting to take chances, Geralt fought with the gang, viciously killing them all off in front of the townspeople before Renfri showed up, who refused to stand down, forcing Geralt to fight and kill her as well. As she died, Stregobor appeared, having seen it all from his crystal ball, and wished to do an autopsy on the dead princess. However, Geralt threatened to slay the mage if he so much as touched Renfri's body, and thus Stregobor left to return to Kovir. The townspeople, not realizing how close they'd come to being hostages and killed off, proceeded to throw stones at Geralt for his actions until Caldemeyn stepped in to stop it. He then asked for Geralt to leave and never return to Blaviken.[3]As Geralt left the tent, he was approached by Merwin, who showed him a scroll from King Henselt of Kaedwen, who told him that Merwin was under the protection of Kaedwen and anyone defying Merwin defied the kingdom. Shortly after in the woods Geralt met Lambert, who had just killed some wolves and explained that Merton Bringgs and his group of dwarves had tried to enter the keep, but Lambert caught them. As Geralt entered the keep, he found Vesemir who informed him that Deidre had returned a couple days earlier, running from her envious brother and an evil sorceress, and that Eskel had told him that Deidre was actually his surprise child from about 20 years ago. Vesemir then told Geralt to go look for Eskel.Geralt soon found Eskel, who explained how Deidre had become his surprise child, but ultimately hadn't decided if he should hand her over to Sabrina or not. The who then made their way back to Vesemir, who decided the 4 should vote on it, with it coming down to Geralt's choice as Eskel chose to trust whatever his fellow witcher decided.If Geralt voted to keep Deidre safe: Geralt and Eskel convinced Deidre to go with them to the camp where the prince and the sorceress were. Once there though, despite Deidre agreeing she'd give up any claim to the throne and any titles and estates like her brother wanted, Sabrina then tried to have Merton arrest her. In the ensuing chaos, Deidre struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and killed Merton with her sword but Sabrina escaped through a portal. The witchers then entered a fight with Merwin's group before Geralt followed Deidre into Sabrina's tent where he found Deidre, Sabrina, and Merwin. Merwin asked Geralt to kill Deidre, but she pleaded for her life saying she didn't mean to hurt Eskel. Geralt then tried to convince Deidre to let her anger towards Sabrina and her brother go, as that was best for everyone.If Geralt told Deidre to leave the keep: Geralt and Eskel informed Deidre she had to leave, with Eskel explaining she was putting Kaer Morhen in danger by being there. Angry at this, she struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and summoned archespores, which attacked the two witchers while she ran off. After dealing with the immediate threats, Geralt informed Vesemir about the situation before going to Sabrina to get her help to heal Eskel, and giving the sorceress permission to hunt down Deidre.The rest of the winter at Kaer Morhen passed more peacefully and Geralt left come spring to continue his trade.[4]Geralt traveled to Gulet on witcher business, where he met Dandelion, a poet who later became his best friend, at a fête. Later Dandelion slept with a woman under the musicians' podium, who had four large brothers. Dandelion fled from the city with Geralt and started to build a friendship with him on their way southeast to Dol Blathanna.[3]After Gulet, Geralt and Dandelion stopped in Upper Posada to look for work, however the only ""monster troubles"" the people could come up with were tall tales and creatures that didn't actually exist, so the two soon left to find another place for work. However, on the road they were soon approached by Nettly, who'd seen them in Upper Posada, and explained he did have business for the witcher, who accepted.Geralt and Dandelion ate supper at the man's house where the group was joined by Dhun, the elder of Lower Posada, who eventually discussed a ""deovel"" named Torque, who had been somewhat helpful, if occasionally pulling pranks on the villagers, but now thing were getting out of hand and they needed something to get rid of Torque, but not kill him.Agreeing to check it out, the witcher and bard went into the nearby hemp field where the ""deovel"" was known to stay and found ""offerings"" set up for the creature. As they looked around, Torque appeared but as Geralt tried to talk with the sylvan, Dandelion started to make jokes at Torque to the point the sylvan began to pelt small, iron balls at the two, making the two runoff.After the attack, the two went back to Lower Posada where they met with Dhun and Nettly, who admitted that they had tried to outwit the ""deovel"" in the past, including trying to trick him into eating the iron pellets he'd thrown at the pair. Eventually, they brought out an old woman and her apprentice, Lille, along with an ancient book. While the old woman, a Wise One, couldn't read the book, she'd memorized it by heart from knowledge passed down to each wise woman, eventually revealing Torque was a sylvan and the reason they just wanted to drive him away was that Lille didn't want him killed.With this in mind, the next day Geralt found Torque and, after a quick game of riddles, the witcher threw an iron ball which hit Torque in the forehead. This surprise attack gave Geralt the opportunity to capture Torque and signal to Dandelion, but a horse appeared and hit him, rendering the witcher unconscious.Shortly after, Geralt woke up to find himself tied up along with Dandelion, with Torque giving Galarr, an elf from the Blue Mountains, three sacks of corn, revealing that Torque had been stealing the food to help the starving elves, as well as passing along agricultural tips he learned from the villagers as the elves didn't know how to farm the land. Noticing the awake prisoners, one of the elves, Toruviel, began to antagonize Geralt before kicking him and smashing Dandelion's lute. Angry at this latter act, Geralt managed to headbutt the elf and another moved to kill the witcher despite Torque's protests that Filavandrel aén Fidháil forbade killing, when Filavandrel himself showed up to stop everything.However, it was clear that the leader planned to have the witcher and bard killed, as they were witnesses to what Torque had been doing, though during this Filavandrel and Geralt conversed, with Geralt noting the elf was filled with hatred towards humans and, despite how his people were starving, too proud to try and cohabit with those he deemed ""inferior"". As the elves moved to shoot Geralt and Dandelion though, Torque stood in front of the pair, fruitlessly trying to defend anyone from being killed and ignoring Geralt's remark to stand aside. Feeling it was necessary, Filavandrel started to give the order to kill the three when Lille suddenly appeared, but in the form of the goddess Dana Meadbh. After silently communicating with the elves, she sent them riding back to the Blue Mountains, but not before Toruviel gave Dandelion her priceless lute for destroying his. Filavandrel then bade farewell to them, remarking Geralt was right about his earlier comments. Later that night, Geralt, Dandelion, and Torque made camp, with Geralt reading over the ancient book he'd collected as his prize for getting rid of Torque, who was moving on from Lower Posada.[3]An unknown time later, Geralt and Dandelion traveled to a village where they went fishing but the line snapped and their meal escaped. The two started to fight about who was at fault and started to leave before Dandelion realized the line had caught an old jar that he thought might contain a djinn. On realizing there was a mage's seal on the jar, Geralt tried to warn the bard not to touch it but in their scuffle, the seal came off and the djinn appeared. As Geralt grabbed his swords, Dandelion began to make wishes, which only angered the djinn and it grabbed Dandelion's throat. With his weapons doing little damage, Geralt grabbed the seal out of desperation and used the words of an exorcism a priestess had taught him and miraculously the djinn ran off.However, the bard was badly injured so Geralt hastily made for Rinde in hopes of finding someone to help. Despite Dandelion's severe injuries, anyone of low stature wasn't allowed to enter after sunset so all they could do was wait it out with the others there, including Chireadan, Errdil, and Vratimir. Eventually the group revealed there was only one known mage in town who could help: Yennefer of Vengerberg who, despite King Heribert's orders that no magic users could stay in Redania, was staying with the honorary Novigrad ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus giving her asylum while she stayed with him.As soon as sunrise hit, Geralt made his way to the ambassador's home, knocking out the doorman, Cerberus, in the process. While he searched the home for the sorceress, he ran into a drunk and naked Berrant, who mentioned a woman wanting juice before he passed out. Geralt got the apple juice, then made his way up to the sorceress' room and gave her the drink, who didn't notice at first that he was not Berrant as she was under the bed covers. However, once she appeared naked from under them, she quickly realized the situation and demanded answers from Geralt, who answered sarcastically, causing her to immediately cast a spell at him which Geralt tried to counter with Heliotrop. Desperate for her help, Geralt changed to a respectful tone, explaining why he'd intruded on her sleep, before eventually revealing the djinn and the exorcism statement he made. However, Yennefer remarked it wasn't an exorcism, just a witty, indecent comment before asking what drove the djinn away and the seal that'd been on the bottle. While Geralt noted it probably went to do one of Dandelion's wishes, he hid the truth about the seal, pretending Dandelion had it. The two then traveled by portal to Errdil's inn so that Yennefer could help the injured bard.As Yennefer worked on healing Dandelion, Geralt and Chireadan discussed the sorceress, with the two men both revealing in their own ways they found her attractive, though the elf noted that Geralt should be wary of Yennefer, as she didn't do things to help others unless she was also getting something out of it. After some time, Yennefer then called the witcher up to the room to see Dandelion only to then release a magical trap on Geralt and revealing she knew he had the seal. After some back and forth comments, Geralt gave it to her as a gesture of goodwill that he'd pay her for her help, however this was fruitless as Yennefer had something else in mind and Geralt quickly deduced she wanted to use Dandelion, who had a connection to the djinn, to try and lure it back to capture it for herself. The witcher adamantly refused to put Dandelion in danger again, but by then Yennefer's other spells took hold, paralyzing the witcher and obscuring the room in a magical shield so nobody could interfere. With that, she then told Geralt he was going to pay for her help by settling some of her accounts in Rinde before violently kissing him, which placed a hypnotic spell on the witcher before he soon lost conscious.Geralt woke to find himself in the city's dungeons with Chireadan, who revealed in his mind-controlled state that Geralt had beat up the local pawnbroker and his apprentice, spanked the local apothecary Laurelnose, took out a group of guards, then made his way to the temple while insulting the priest, Krepp, as all 3 were on the town council and had voted to kick Yennefer out of Rinde while also spreading vulgar gossip about her. However, before Geralt could make it to the temple he fainted and the guards threw him into the dungeons, with Chireadan having been caught in the chaos and thrown in as well. Just then, several guards sent by Laurelnose came in and began to beat up Geralt, but when the one throwing the punches asked if the witcher had any wishes, Geralt stated he just had one: that the guard would burst and, before another punch could be thrown, the guard's body literally burst, killing him instantly.With that, Geralt and Chireadan were brought before the mayor, Neville, with Krepp also in attendance, with the latter noting it must have been the sorceress' work as neither the witcher or elf had control of the force to do so. After revealing almost the entire story to the mayor and priest, Krepp then concluded Yennefer wanted the djinn as it would give the sorceress a great deal of power and when the conversation turned to what Geralt said that made the genie run off, Geralt repeated the supposed exorcism only for Krepp to become insulted by it. Before more could be asked on this, Dandelion suddenly fell into the room through a portal, proclaiming Geralt was innocent and that Yennefer had ordered him to state before the mayor his wish was for them to believe the witcher wasn't guilty. Krepp quickly deduced it was the sorceress' way of using the last wish to free the genie so she could capture it when the group heard a thunderous noise outside of the building and looked out to see the djinn flying above Errdil's tavern, having being magically lassoed by Yennefer. However, the djinn wasn't going down without a fight and was destroying all the nearby buildings as it tried to break free.Wishing to save Yennefer, Geralt got Krepp to cast a spell to re-open the portal Dandelion had come through but not before asking what the words of the exorcism he said earlier meant, to which Krepp paraphrased that it meant ""get out of here and go fuck yourself!"". With that, Geralt entered the portal and landed in Errdil's tavern and where Yennefer was still trying to capture the genie while her powers waned. Seeing Geralt, she opened a portal to send him away as the djinn entered the tavern through its own portal to kill the sorceress, but Geralt threw himself between the two, shielding Yennefer. Shockingly, the genie didn't attack the witcher, but appeared to roar in an unknown language at him. Trying to get Yennefer away from it, Geralt pulled the sorceress through the portal she'd opened, though she yelled and threw punches at the witcher, claiming she almost had the genie, before rushing back through the portal with Geralt trying to grab her once more. As they crashed back in the tavern, Yennefer managed to cast a spell to pin the witcher down, but Geralt, trying to save her, informed her of the truth: he was the one making the wishes as he'd been the one holding the seal when he made his first wish (the ""exorcism"") and had one wish left.As a weakened Yennefer demanded Geralt make his last wish so she could hopelessly try to capture the genie, Geralt finally realized what he wanted and that would also save Yennefer from the genie's wrath and wished their fates be tied, thus freeing the genie while preventing it from killing the sorceress. With that, the genie escaped back to its realm and Geralt and Yennefer proceeded to make love in the destroyed tavern.[3]After the events in Rinde, Yennefer and Geralt started a rather physical relationship, spending the majority of their time at Yennefer 's home in Vengerberg, Aedirn, and putting to good use a wide variety of the sorceress' collection, including a stuffed unicorn, as well as having sex in rather unusual situations, like levitating 30 fanthoms above ground. However, the witcher finally decided to leave after half a year in the city, considering Yennefer's behavior as too possessive. Unable to initiate the parting though, the witcher ran off during the night, leaving only a rose and a letter on the bed as his farewell.TBAA while later, Geralt traveled to Vizima and visited The Fox but, while in the process of trying to find a bed to rent, was attacked by three racists who didn't approve of his Rivian accent. A short fight unfolded where Geralt killed the men but right after members of the city guard appeared and attempted to arrest him, though using Axii, Geralt was able to manipulate them into taking him to Velerad, the city castellan, instead.Once he met Velerad, the pair took time discussing the real reason Geralt was passing through: King Foltest of Temeria had put out a contract to cure his daughter, Adda the White, who was cursed and turned into a striga. After Geralt went and saw Foltest, and they reached an agreement: for 3,000 orens, Geralt would try to successfully release Adda from her curse, without killing her, as many had attempted in the past. The witcher then discussed the plan further with Foltest's underlings, Ostrit, Velerad, and Segelin, who agreed the witcher should spend a night in the old city with the striga.Four days later, after talking to survivors of the beast, speaking further with Foltest, and finalizing plans, Geralt traveled to the old, abandoned palace and set up camp there, preparing his potions and meditating before he was found by Ostrit in the dead city. The magnate then tried to bribe the witcher with 1,000 orens to leave the place and never return, all while keeping the cursed Adda in her form. As Geralt questioned Ostrit's reasoning, noting a striga on the loose would make people lose faith in their king and possibly remove Foltest, the magnate grew frustrated and tried to fight the witcher, who quickly knocked out the man and tied him up.Ostrit came to shortly after and soon realized Geralt planned to use him as bait to lure out Adda. He then confessed to the witcher he did want to overthrow Foltest, but more than that, he wanted the king to suffer because Foltest had taken the one Ostrit had loved, Adda of Temeria, who was the king's own deceased sister and lover. However, he was adamant he couldn't have possibly caused the curse as he didn't know how to use magic and that Foltest and Adda's mother, Sancia of Sodden, must have done it as she too didn't agree with the incestous relationship. Geralt, however, heard the beast start to move out of her crypt and cut the magnate loose, who quickly took off to try and fruitlessly escape, but was quickly killed by the striga.Geralt and the striga then faced off against each other, though Geralt took care not to kill her, only looking to buy enough time to get her away from her crypt. Eventually managing to send her running, Geralt quickly hid himself in her tomb and closed it, casting Yrden on the cover before meditating until dawn. Awaking a few hours later, right at dawn, he slipped out of the tomb to find Adda, now in human form, lying next to the tomb. However, as Geralt checked her teeth to make sure the transformation was complete, the still transforming girl awoke and slashed deep cuts in Geralt's neck with her talons. The witcher quickly pinned her down until she completely transformed back to human, but right after Geralt fainted from the blood loss.Two days later, Geralt woke up in the new palace with Velerad looking after him, who explained they'd raced into the old palace right after dawn and found the badly injured witcher and saved him. Geralt then asked about the princess' condition and as the castellan explained she was fine, Geralt fell asleep once more.[3]After fighting and releasing the striga, Geralt traveled to Ellander to recover at the Temple of Melitele. He was cared to by and quickly developed a relationship with one of the priestesses, Iola, who was studying under Nenneke, who he ended up sleeping with, as she reminded him of Yennefer. The next morning, the two were arose by Nenneke, who didn't want them in a relationship together, so she sent Iola out to continue with her duties. The older priestess had a look at Geralt's injuries and then after some assessment, sent the witcher to go eat breakfast, before joining him again in the temple gardens.The two then discussed Iola using magic to put Geralt in a trance, and maybe reveal something about his destiny and future, though the witcher didn't want to undergo such a thing. Not long after that, Count Falwick and Arthur Tailles, members of the Order of the White Rose, arrived at the temple and confronted Geralt and Nenneke, asking the witcher to leave Ellander by the orders of Duke Hereward. Tailles' attitude was met by Nenneke who declared the temple belonged to her and she decided who came and left, threatening the young knight with a small porcelain jar that was potentially harmful. Geralt decided to tell the men of his plans to leave Ellander in the next few days and adding insult to injury, started to insult Tailles, who furiously left the temple with his partner.Geralt later went and saw Iola, explaining Kaer Morhen and his training as a witcher, as well as contracts he had taken throughout his life on the path. After spending some time alone and reading, Geralt was informed by Nenneke that Dandelion was at the temple to visit him, just before the poet turned around the corner. The two discussed recent events and Dandelion's education before the witcher bought out vodka and they started to drink, with Geralt complaining about a lack of work in the area. After his drink with Dandelion, Geralt went to the grotto in the garden and had a look at the many exotic herbs there while Nenneke harvested them. She asked him to stay a couple more days at the temple, which request was quickly turned down by the witcher, as he was preparing to leave that day.After leaving the temple with Dandelion, the witcher started to ride towards the city of Ellander before he was confronted by Falwick, Tailles and Dennis Cranmer, with Falwick declaring the young knight and the witcher must fight, as Tailles' pride had been injured at the temple. Falwick then informed Geralt that he had to throw the fight, as hitting the knight would have him arrested and thrown in front of Hereward. Geralt agreed to the fight and easily outmanoeuvred the young knight, making him hit himself in the face, which Falwick believed was worth Cranmer arresting Geralt according to his orders, but the dwarf believed that Tailles had hit himself and that wasn't worth arresting the witcher for. As Geralt prepared to leave, he threatened Falwick, saying if he ever threatened Nenneke or Cranmer again, he would die for it.The two headed back to the temple, where he prepared to travel, packing up his horse and saying his goodbyes. Iola came out and gave him his elixirs and after their hands touched, she started to suffer a seizure, which Nenneke told Geralt to ignore and leave, which he did.[3]TBAA while later, Geralt and Yennefer traveled to the city of Aedd Gynvael in Narok, and during their stay in the city, Geralt took on a contract on a nasty zeugl that had infested the sewers. While fighting the beast, he got stuck in a rubbish heap and was dragged through the filth, and after striking the killing blow, the beast's slime and bile spilled all over the witcher, adding to his stench.In May 1272, Geralt and Vesemir were headed to the village of Willoughby, following the instructions of a recent letter from Yennefer, who they were tracking. They stopped in White Orchard, hearing news that Willoughby had been burnt to the ground. Following a nightmare about Ciri and the Wild Hunt, Geralt rode with Vesemir to a ford, where they encountered the merchant Bram being attacked by a royal griffin, which they drove off. After arriving at the White Orchard inn, they spoke with the innkeep Elsa. Geralt and Vesemir then sat down, before Geralt introduced himself to Gaunter O'Dimm, and then asked about Yennefer, with the merchant stating she had ridden through White Orchard to the Nilfgaardian Garrison.After riding to the garrison, Geralt met Peter Saar Gwynleve, a Nilfgaardian officer. He told Geralt that he would tell the witcher about Yennefer's location if he killed the griffin plaguing White Orchard. After agreeing, the captain pointed two people who could help him with griffin issue, the hunter Mislav and the herbalist Tomira. Geralt needed to visit Tomira, to find out where buckthorn, an aqueous plant that would lure the griffin, grew in the area. She pointed him to the Ismena river, which flowed straight through the center of town. After diving down and obtaining some buckthorn, Geralt headed to Mislav for more information about the griffin, but couldn't find him at his hut, and instead found him hunting in the woods. Mislav asked that the witcher help kill some wild dogs that were attacking villagers, which was an easy job for Geralt, but hard for Mislav, as he found that the dogs had killed his former lord's stable hand. Mislav then took Geralt to the site of where the griffin had attacked some Nilfgaardian soldiers, so Geralt said his thanks and then started to investigate the scene. After following footprints, he came across the creature's nest, in the middle of the Vulpine Woods, with the griffin's female mate lying dead in the nest, killed by Nilfgaardian soldiers, who had provoked the current male griffin to attack.Note: Geralt may have just found the attack sight and buckthorn exploring, without the help of Mislav and Tomira.After preparing for the fight, Geralt returned to the inn and laid the plan out to Vesemir. The two of them set the buckthorn-stuffed sheep in a nearby field, and Vesemir gave Geralt his first ever personal crossbow, before the griffin arrived. The two fought the griffin, even when it flew away to a nearby windmill, until they killed it. Geralt took its head to the garrison, where Peter Saar Gwynleve was whipping the local ealdorman for delivery of rotten grain. After showing the griffin's head, the Nilfgaardian captain told Geralt that Yennefer was in nearby Vizima. Angered at the fact she was less than a day's ride the entire time, Geralt could either accept or decline the coin, before heading back to the inn.Inside the inn with Vesemir, Geralt went to buy provisions for the road, but the atmosphere was very dangerous, with several racists attacking the two witchers after they tried to break up a fight. Killing the men caused Elsa to be disgusted and demand they leave at once, though directly outside the tavern stood Yennefer, with a Nilfgaardian escort, much to Geralt's relief, as he had finally found her. The sorceress explained that Emporer Emhyr var Emreis had summoned Geralt to Vizima, and that he come with her back to the palace. Saying his goodbyes to Vesemir, he rode with them, through to the night when the Wild Hunt attacked the soldiers, Geralt and Yennefer, though the sorceress and witcher were the only to survive thanks to Yennefer's magic.[6]TBAMost of the time, he could be apathetic, cynical, and threatening. Despite his outwardly cold nature, Dandelion noted that behind his exterior was hiding a fiercely loyal friend, and a man of good humour and as someone not indifferent to suffering. Geralt had many good friends all over the Northern Realms, such as Caldemeyn of Blaviken, Zoltan Chivay, and of course Dandelion. He was also very protective of and loyal to his friends and companions, and was willing to go to great lengths for those who mattered to him. He could be kind-hearted and caring to the people he loved.Geralt was also shown to be extremely adept at allaying intense, and at times bleak, situations and as a man who would much sooner have everyone return home than draw their swords. His lifespan made him a world-weary man, often expressing disdain and circuitous insults to those he considered cruel, foolish, etc. He may have risked Temeria's future to save Triss Merigold from the Nilfgaardians. He also was shown requesting Scoia'tael to spare Dandelion and kill only him.Geralt frequently showed remorse and had revelations in his life. Other times he had complete emotional breakdowns, even giving up being a witcher in general and dropping his morals at one point.The story of Geralt and Ciri became a popular saga many years, probably centuries, after the actual events had taken place. The chief sources of these stories were Dandelion's ballads and the bard's autobiography Half a Century of Poetry. However, Dandelion was not fond of telling the whole truth, and ultimately many versions of Geralt's and Ciri's adventures were spread far and wide, including simplified and harmless children's tales, leading scholars to struggle in distinguishing those stories that were considered canon from those that seemed non-canonical and embellished.Many years in the future, the sorceress Nimue verch Wledyr ap Gwyn and her assistant Condwiramurs Tilly conducted extensive research into the matter, in an attempt to determine what had really happened to Geralt and Ciri.After seemingly having been killed by a mob during a pogrom of nonhumans at the end of the Witcher saga, Geralt returns to life with no recollection of the details of his sudden reappearance or of the five intervening years. He is rescued by the last remaining witchers in the world and is taken back to Kaer Morhen. There, he is drawn into a complicated conspiracy concerning the witchers, their secrets, and the nefarious forces that are after that knowledge.Shortly after Geralt's return to Kaer Morhen, an attack is launched on the fortress by an unknown organization, spearheaded by two mages. Though one mage is unknown to her, Triss recognizes the other as Savolla. Geralt provides assistance to his friends in repelling the attack, before Vesemir proclaims that the party must split up as the two mages, having unleashed a frightener in the main courtyard, have descended into the witchers' laboratory to procure the secrets they are in pursuit of. Vesemir offers Geralt the choice of either going after the mages with Triss, or staying to assist the other witchers in defeating the frightener.Later, Leo and Geralt find Triss in an injured state, and descend to the laboratory in order to stop the mages from absconding with the secret formulae. When confronted with the witchers, one of the attackers, namely, The Professor, kills Leo with a crossbow bolt before teleporting away, along with the mages and a sizeable portion of the witchers' writings.During Leo's funeral, Vesemir decides that the attackers, known as Salamandra, must be tracked down and forced to pay for their transgressions. He tells Geralt to use Temeria as a starting point in his search, as he once lifted a curse there from Foltest's daughter.Geralt pursues the mysterious Salamandra, and in the process meets many people from his past, as well as new acquaintances who either require the witcher's help or offer their own in his quest to regain his identity.Vizima is under quarantine due to the Catriona plague, and Geralt cannot enter it as he lacks the necessary letter of safe conduct. Thus, he settles in Vizima's outskirts. During the night, Geralt is attacked by spectral hounds, known as barghests, which were in pursuit of a woman and child. The witcher manages to rescue a boy named Alvin, who levitates and recites Ithlinne's Prophecy in a disturbing voice after the attack, revealing himself to be a Source. Shortly thereafter, Geralt meets Shani, a red-haired medic hailing from Oxenfurt who arrived here to help quell the Catriona epidemic. She decides to place the now-orphaned Alvin under her care. Geralt also meets the alchemist Kalkstein, a trader named Declan Leuvaarden, and Zoltan Chivay, an old friend from Geralt's past life.Geralt seeks out the Reverend, who agrees to assist him in obtaining passage to the city if he fulfils the contract on The Beast, a certain entity which is thought to be responsible for the barghests. The Reverend sends Geralt to assist three pillars of the community: Odo, Mikul, and Haren Brogg.The trader Odo tasks Geralt with weeding out the echinops in his garden after a session of heavy drinking. Mikul sends the witcher to clear the local crypt of ghouls, wherein Geralt discovers the corpse of a poisoned woman. Haren Brogg tasks Geralt with driving away the drowners from his goods by the riverbank. It becomes apparent, however, that Haren is actually a hawker, after a regiment of Scoia'tael attempts to take away the goods Geralt was tasked to protect.The Reverend then offers Geralt to deal with Abigail, a local witch, to whom Shani has now transferred her responsibility over Alvin. The witch carries out a magical procedure in which she attempts to communicate with the spirit of the White Frost in Alvin awakened by the Beast. It confers that the Beast's appearance was caused by the sins of the local residents.Geralt returns to the Inn, wherein he discovers a group of Salamandra fighters assaulting Shani. After dealing with them, the witcher pursues the other members of the Salamandra. Upon reaching their cavernous lair, Geralt discovers Alvin inside who was taken from Abigail's home and turned over to the group by the Reverend and his followers. Further along the cave system, Geralt and Alvin meet Abigail, who asks for the witcher's help in fleeing the enraged crowd that has amassed outside. Geralt makes a choice, either to save Abigail from being lynched, or to leave her to the judgment of the Outskirts' residents. After deciding, he defeats the Beast and the barghests.Later, after receiving a pass into Vizima from the Reverend, or taking it from his corpse, Geralt returns to the Inn, and travels to the city with Shani. However, he is stopped by Mikul at the gates and is turned over to the city guard.The third installment of the trilogy, like its predecessors, follows Geralt through his final adventures. Following the events of Witcher 2, Geralt has regained his memory of the past and prepares to embark on a new journey. In the Witcher 3, Geralt is on the hunt for the only person he considers kin, Ciri.

"231","Henselt","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Last of the UnicornsLord of Ard CarraighArchduke of Ban ArdSovereign of VspadenHenselt was the king of Kaedwen, formally styled as His Majesty Henselt, King of Kaedwen, heir to the Dynasty of the Unicorn, Lord of Ard Carraigh, Archduke of Ban Ard, and vanquisher of Nilfgaard. For many years, he engaged in an ongoing dispute with King Demavend III of Aedirn over the Lormark. Henselt was also the architect of a plan to exterminate all non-humans in areas bound by the Pontar, Gwenllech, and Buina rivers. He sported a classic beard and had small, penetrating eyes.Henselt spent a great deal of time, energy and money dealing with the Squirrels. He married a woman whose name is not known and she bore him one son who had married before ultimately dying in a hunting accident.His commissar was Vilfrid Wenck. After the war with Nilfgaard, he was one of the negotiators of the peace treaty.King Henselt stumbled ungainly on the dance floor and tripped over his tongue at courtly salons. On the battlefield, however, he moved as deftly as a fish in water. He knew all his infantryman by name and could recite the range of each and every catapult to the inch. Indeed, he adored his war machines. He would walk the ranks of his catapults like a proud father, tenderly stroking each ballista and trebuchet. He kept dozens and dozens of these contraptions in reserve - and built more any chance he got.Henselt would often say two heads are better than one,and three - even better still. Thus he'd always order his troops to march into battle in threes, trios of soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder. His generals were skeptical of his strategy...but changed their minds when they saw the results.[1]In The Price of Neutrality premium module, King Henselt does not actually appear. He is referred to numerous times, most notably because of a rather badly spelled letter of safe conduct he has allegedly given to Merwin Ademeyn and his retinue.Henselt is the king of Kaedwen at the time of this particular story. The sorceress, Sabrina Glevissig and Merwin both sit on his council. According to Merton Bringgs, the sorceress wields an unusually strong influence of the king and therefore the whole council. He says that she has been known to pound her fist on the council table and actually tell the king himself to be quiet, and apparently the king has obliged.It is apparently under the king's auspices that the ""search"" for Deidre has been organized. Merwin is the official leader of the expedition, but it becomes clear quite early in the story that the true leader is Sabrina.Known to be excessively greedy and hot-headed, Henselt is the king of Kaedwen, a powerful and expansive land in the North. He in no way resembles the classic image of a king. He is bearded as a robber and has small, penetrating, wandering eyes. Henselt feuds with his neighbors over borders, titles and protectorates. He is also known for his intense hatred of nonhumans.Henselt, King of Kaedwen, heir to the Dynasty of the Unicorn, Lord of Ard Carraigh, Archduke of Ban Ard and vanquisher of Nilfgaard, makes his first appearance in the game at the beginning of Chapter II when Prince Stennis and Saskia confront him and demand that he withdraw his forces from Aedirn.Henselt is advised by the sorcerer Dethmold, and is heavily influenced by him. Henselt is seen as an arrogant person and completely amoral. This, paired with his sense of royal immunity make him an unpopular king to some, especially among a number of his own nobility.Despite this Henselt has managed to strengthen Kaedwen as a state and improved the lives of thousands of his people. His lack of heir however would result in a civil war for his country should he die.King Henselt does not appear in the third installment. Whether he was spared or killed seemed to have made little impact as Redania conquers Kaedwen during the War.If Geralt allowed Roche to kill Henselt: With Henselt's death, Kaedwen is weakened and was no match for Radovid's invasion, surrendering and submitting to Redania after a few skirmishes.If Geralt chose to spare King Henselt in Roche's path or he chose Iorveth's path: King Radovid invades Kaedwen and King Henselt is killed during combat, weakening the kingdom and forcing it to submit to Redania.Henselt is a leader in the Homecoming version."

"236","Iorweth","Elf (Aen Seidhe)","Male","Guerrilla fighter Unit commander Rank(s) Commander Officer"," Letho Scoia'tael Vrihedd Brigade","Iorweth (Iorveth in the English version of the games) was an Aen Seidhe elf and the commander of the last Scoia'tael commando to be broken during the second war with Nilfgaard.He was not just an extremely skilled bowman but a swordsman as well. He defeated the commanders of many special forces of the North, including someone from the Order of the Flaming Rose, except for the Blue Stripes captain Vernon Roche. His other skills included playing the recorder.Even though he was always extremely proud of his race, Iorweth's clothes were a combination of elven and human clothing. He didn't acquire them all at once but rather stack it up with useful pieces from armors of humans he killed.[1]Iorweth and Isengrim Faoiltiarna were supposedly the only two who survived the massacre of the Vrihedd Brigade at the Ravine of the Hydra, following the peace of Cintra.Throughout the entirety of the Second Northern War, Iorweth was allied with the Nilfgaardian Empire and led a Scoia'tael commando with which he constantly caused trouble to rear of Northern Kingdoms' combined forces in the Pontar valley.One of the elves under his command was Echel Traighlethan who was captured by the Redanian Secret Service and brought to Drakenborg to be hanged.[2]When the peace of Cintra was signed between the North and Nilfgaardians on 2 April 1268, all of the Vrihedd Brigade officers and Scoia'tael leaders were rounded up to be executed in line with what was agreed at negotiations.[3]Iorweth somehow managed to escape and survive long enough to assemble a new commando from elves dissatisfied with the outcome of the war. One by one, Iorweth and his guerilla fighters defeated most of the Northern special forces with the major exception being the Blue Stripes of Temeria.Sometime around November 1270, Iorweth was approached by a mysterious individual claiming to be a friend of nonhumans with an offer: the man wanted to kill kings for his own inscrutable reasons and would like Iorweth's help in the form of the elf's knowledge of secret trails and weapon stashes. To back his claim, this man showed Iorweth the head of Demavend, King of Aedirn, Lord of Dol Blathanna and Sovereign of the Pontar Valley.Four months later, Geralt, Triss, and Vernon Roche met Iorweth. Roche quickly showed that he knew the elf and they were quite hostile to each other, hinting at less-than-pleasant past experiences. Shortly afterward, it became clear that Iorweth managed to rebuild the commandos he lost during the war, as elves attacked Geralt and company on his orders.He was pushed by circumstances to the very edge of society, painfully aware that the Scoia'tael have been used in the war with Nilfgaard and have been ruthlessly sacrificed during peace negotiations. He was also determined not to let that happen again. He enjoyed a fierce loyalty from his men. None of them would ever betray Iorweth and this speaks volumes in his favor. Indeed, he was a skilled commander and as cunning as a fox.Considered a mass murderer and terrorist, even by Saskia, he had nonetheless come to understand that the ways of the Scoia'tael are doomed to fail, hence the reason he did not join Yaevinn and instead chose to fight side by side with humans and dwarves led by Saskia to secure the foundation of an independent state in Upper Aedirn, with a capital in Vergen. A state with egalitarian laws between elves, humans and dwarves.No matter the outcome of the conflict, Iorweth had already left Aedirn by the spring of 1272. He took his Scoia'tael with him, departing for unknown reasons. Unfortunately, his departure significantly reduced Vergen's military capabilities.[4] Though it's not confirmed where he went to, he was alive and safe there at least the remainder of the year.[5]Chapter I:Chapter II:Chapter III:Iorveth's Gwent card artworkIn the final game, Iorveth and Isengrim are mentioned by their fellow Scoia'tael warriors, in a camp outside of Novigrad. These lines may perhaps be the remnants of the cut content. He also has a Gwent hero card.Marcin Momot later confirmed that Iorveth is alive and well but that he would not appear in the game.[5][8] On 4 July 2016 short comic strip named Where is Iorveth? was released.Iorveth was involved in the large Nilfgaardian centric subplot which centered around an outbreak of the Catriona plague. This quest line had its own set of writers and designers, and remnants of the quest line exist in the form of: An Eye for an Eye, Blood Ties, and Contract: Patrol Gone Missing.[9] This quest line was also the original implementation of the Hearts of Stone expansion, before it was cut and completely redone for the expansion pack.[10]Iorveth would have appeared in Velen searching for a cure for the Catriona plague which was ravaging Velen and most of the southern part of the Continent, including Mahakam. Geralt would have to form a sensitive alliance between Iorveth, Roche, Ves and Thaler in order to obtain this cure from a rogue Nilfgaardian scientist called Martin aka Hector Krafft Ebbing. This questline was also meant to explore the Nilfgaardian's impact on the area, showing that they were not always the most enlightened group of people, and would go to extreme lengths in the name of law and order.[11]A playable build of this quest line existed, and was cut very late into production due to allegedly not fitting in well with the rest of the game, and requiring too many resources to complete.[12]A model was worked on internally, and a render of his character was set to be included in the Prima Guide. The original plan would have involved Geralt meeting him in Novigrad, along with other Scoia'tael.He would have had a role in at least 6 quests: Pyres of Novigrad, Get Junior, sq305-Scoia'tael (which later became Woodland Beast), a cut side-quest called sq309-Investigation, The Battle of Kaer Morhen and Final Preparations.Not much is known about SQ309-Investigation, but it would have involved a scene with Iorveth hiding in a basement of a house in the non-human district. He would have been playing his flute, using the same song, Stella Splendens, from The Witcher 2. This quest would have also featured an Elven Portal, although it's not specified what it would have been used for.SQ305-Scoia'tael would have involved other Scoia'tael commanders, such as Isengrim Faoiltiarna, Vernossiel, Gronostaj and Yrlissa. This quest was significantly reworked, and made it into the game as Woodland Beast. Vernossiel made the cut, but none of the other characters did. This quest was also mentioned in the preliminary Prima Guide.At the beginning of Pyres of Novigrad, he would have helped Geralt find Triss, and they would have gone to her house together. This would have made a lot of sense depending on your choices in The Witcher 2, as Triss can save his life in the epilogue. He would also have had connections to the criminal underground, knowing both The King of Beggars and Cleaver. There are mentions of other dialogue scenes, between Roche, Iorveth and Geralt, at the docks in Novigrad. A bug report from an Alpha build states that the writers needed to fully explain the relationship dynamic between them, and why they wanted to kill each other, because of events in the past.He would have taken part in the Battle of Kaer Morhen. The dialogue scenes between Roche, Letho and Ves were originally meant to be between Roche, Letho and Iorveth. File names for these cutscenes, in the retail product, reference this original plan:""quests/part_2/quest_files/q403_battle/scenes/q403_10_letho_vs_roche_iorweth.w2scene""""quests/part_2/quest_files/q403_battle/scenes/q403_11_roche_iorweth.w2scene""""quests/part_2/quest_files/q403_battle/scenes/q403_34a_roche_iorweth_after_battle.w2scene"".Character descriptions for both Iorveth and Isengrim Faoiltiarna were also going to appear in the preliminary Prima guide.[13]Comments about Iorveth from the CDPR developers Jan Bartkowicz (Story Writer), Artur Sliwinski, (Story Writer), Arkadiusz Borowik (Story Writer) and Jan Marek (Concept Artist) taken from the ""Dev Diary 3"":"

Known for his biting tongue, he was often rude in conversation. He was particularly rude towards Triss Merigold, addressing her only by her last name, which irritated the sorceress greatly. He does not have much use for politics, a trait common to most witchers due to their code of neutrality. He helped train Ciri in the art of combat. He was described as being at the same age as Coën. He is one of the last witchers to be trained within the walls of Kaer Morhen.Lambert appears in the main campaign of The Witcher, as well as The Price of Neutrality premium module. Despite not being fond of her, when Triss was sick and wounded after a fight with a wizard, Lambert cared for her helping to nurse her back to health. Vesemir suggests this might be because he feels guilty.In The Witcher, he is wandering around the ground floor of Kaer Morhen or busy in the courtyard for the duration of the Prologue.In ""The Price of Neutrality"", he can be found staking out the ford nearest the camp, keeping the local weed problem in check and making sure the unexpected guests do not suddenly try to enter the keep.Lambert is back in the third installment of The Witcher Series and seems to have a deep seated jealousy towards Geralt, as Geralt is an extremely famous and beloved witcher, while Lambert considers his witcher status a cruel twist of fate, and is stuck hunting relatively benign monsters for people who hate witchers.Like some of his fellow monster slayers, he dislikes the lack of choice he had in becoming a witcher; when he was a child, his father continually beat him and his mother until one day his father stumbled onto a Nekker's nest where a witcher saved his life. The witcher then invoked the law of surprise, demanding the first thing the father would see, yet not expect when returning home. Since that day, Lambert despises his lot in life but walks the path nonetheless, for he knows nothing else.Geralt had a dream in the May of 1272, in which he practised training at Kaer Morhen. When he and Ciri walked down to the lower courtyard, they trained with Eskel and Lambert, or more specificially Lambert trained with Eskel, Vesemir with Geralt and Ciri with a training dummy.Eskel and Lambert at Kaer Morhen keepDuring Geralt's travels looking for Ciri, he could encounter Lambert after taking a ekimmara contract. After they had slain the ekimmara, they got to chatting, and Geralt helped track down three members of Jad Karadin's band, Vienne, Lund and Hammond. After they hunted the three down, they hunted down Jad, and confronted him. Geralt could choose to help Lambert kill him or he could stay out of it.After Geralt arrived back to Kaer Morhen, after investigating all leads on Ciri, with Uma, he went with Lambert to the Circle of Elements to repair the phylactery. On the way they encountered several problems, such as trolls and foglets. Lambert later participated in The Battle of Kaer Morhen.If Geralt got to Lambert in time to save him from the Wild Hunt: Geralt and Lambert fought the Wild Hunt side-by-side, and both survived the battle.

"247","Letho of Gulet","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher Assassin"," School of the Viper Kingslayers Emhyr var Emreis Vattier de Rideaux","Letho of Gulet, also known as the Kingslayer, was a witcher from the School of the Viper. His closest associates were Auckes and Serrit, also kingslayers and fellow witchers from the School of the Viper. Letho enlisted the help of Iorveth and the Scoia'tael to aid him in his plan to kill the kings of the Northern Kingdoms; to back his claim, the Viper showed Iorveth a head that belonged to Demavend III, the king of Aedirn, whom Letho had previously slain.In the forests of Angren on July 25, 1270, Letho was near death after being struck by a slyzard's tail but Geralt, a witcher from the School of the Wolf, found and saved him while chasing after the Wild Hunt to rescue Yennefer. As thanks for saving his life, Letho told Geralt where to find the Wild Hunt and, alongside his own companions, travelled with him to find the spectral riders. Eventually, the group caught up with the Wild Hunt on the Winter Solstice, by the Hanged Man's Tree in Nilfgaard. Despite their skill, the witchers couldn't defeat all the warriors and a stalemate ensued before Geralt offered himself in exchange for Yennefer.Feeling it'd be disrespectful to Geralt to just leave the sorceress somewhere, Letho and the witchers took care of her. However, she was in pain, suffering from amnesia and caused an endless source of trouble for the group, which, in the Nilfgaardian Empire, meant she was liable to get caught and killed. While the group traveled constantly to try and avoid attention, they were eventually detained and thrown in jail. However, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself later approached Letho and offered him a deal he couldn't refuse: sow chaos in the North by killing some of its rulers, lay the blame on the Lodge of Sorceresses, and the School of the Viper would be restored.King Esterad Thyssen of Kovir and Poviss was initially Letho's first target, but this never came to be as the kingslayers came into contact with Síle de Tansarville, who contracted Letho with assassinating King Demavend and helped to organise it. Thus, in 1271, Letho snuck onboard Demavend's ship out on the Pontar and, using a Northern Wind-based capsule, froze most of the ship and nearly everyone on board except a handful that were protected by Abelard's counter spell. However, this wasn't enough and all the guards fell to Letho's blade before he rounded on the king and killed him, then cut off his head for proof. Per de Tansarville's suggestion, Letho subsequently sought out Iorveth with the head in tow; yet, instead of merely using the Scoia'tael in order to lie low after the killing as Síle had envisaged, Letho also secured an alliance between the kingslayers and the Scoia'tael, whereby the latter would help Letho and his comrades to kill the kings of the North in whatever way they could.Because of the kingslayers' first attempt on King Foltest's life having failed due to Geralt being there at the time of the attack and the would-be assassin's death, Letho planned a second attempt on the Temerian monarch's life with Iorveth, while being out of Síle's or anyone else's reach. Aware of the imminent siege at La Valette Castle, Letho decided to pose as a monk guarding over the king's children - a disguise which he enacted by framing himself as a helpless monk being tortured and then killing the person who treated him to keep the secret. Foltest, after successfully taking over the castle, appeared with Geralt, now acting as a bodyguard, at which point the king asked for Geralt to give him and the children some space. With his back turned, Geralt heard the attack too late as Letho revealed himself just after he killed Foltest and fled out a window to escape with Scoia'tael assistance, leaving Geralt to be wrongly accused of regicide. Shortly after this assassination, Letho attempted to betray Iorveth by turning one of his lieutenants against him. However, the elf refused, so Letho killed his entire unit to cover his tracks and left Ciaran to be captured by Flotsam's guards.In an attempt to catch Letho, Geralt, who now knew that Letho had attempted to get rid of Iorveth, the elf to the kingslayer as a ruse to expose the latter's treachery. However, Iorveth and his Scoia'tael were attacked by the Blue Stripes, leaving Geralt and Letho to battle each other. Letho prevailed in the battle with Geralt, but once the Wolf was down, he spared him. Letho revealed that Geralt once saved his life and so they were now ""even"", before running off to kidnap Triss and force her to teleport them to Aedirn. He succeeded in capturing the sorceress, but fought and killed Cedric in the process as he tried to defend her.After arriving in Vergen, Letho abandoned Triss and regrouped with Serrit and Auckes in their hideout. Knowing that the Scoia'tael in the area would soon become aware of his betrayal, Letho and his two comrades massacred them, leaving only one survivor. Upon hearing about the upcoming summit at Loc Muinne, Letho headed there, entrusting Serrit and Auckes with assassinating Henselt.Knowing that Síle had become a liability for him, Letho sabotaged her megascope by replacing one of the crystals with a flawed one in order to dispose of her. Unless Geralt intervenes, Letho is successful and Síle explodes. Afterwards, the kingslayer waited in the center of the Temerian Quarter in Loc Muinne to talk with his former companion. Letho offered Geralt vodka, while explaining that he never had anything personal against him and proceeded to tell him about his deal with the emperor, the fate of Yennefer, and all that he knew about the Wild Hunt.If Geralt fights Letho: the two fought one last time and Geralt ultimately defeated Letho, killing him.If Geralt lets Letho go: Letho and Geralt parted ways, believing they'd never see each other again.Note: if Letho was killed at the end of the second game, what follows below isn't applicable.Having succeeded in tearing the North apart, Letho learned afterwards that it was all for naught, with Emperor Emhyr not only going back on his word to restore the School of the Viper but, as Letho was now a living witness to the emperor's plans, the witcher was a liability and assassins were sent after him. With a high price on his head and bounty hunters chasing him everywhere, Letho traveled around, not staying anywhere too long, before he dropped in at the abandoned Reardon Manor in Velen in 1272. Coincidentally, Geralt was in the area as well on unrelated business.If Geralt doesn't help him out: the two parted ways, with Letho heading off to take care of his business by himself.If Geralt helps him out: Letho and Geralt talked for a bit, with Letho explaining his ""on the run"" situation before a group of scouts arrived, no doubt sent to see if Letho was there. After the two witchers killed them off, Letho asked his former friend for help in dealing with the bounty hunters and the two set out together to track down Louis, an acquaintance of Letho's and the only one who knew where the witcher was hiding, having recommended the manor to Letho. It turned out that Louis sold him out and, not one to forgive such actions, Letho left him to die. He then had Geralt follow him to Lindenvale and told Geralt that whatever happened next, to not interfere, before throwing a bomb at a nearby barn, causing it to explode and several armed bounty hunters to run out of a nearby hut. After a short conversation between Letho and the group's leader, Arnout Vester, one of the bounty hunters shot a crossbow at the witcher and he attacked, killing off six of them before falling over, seeming dead. Letho woke up sometime later, with Geralt waiting nearby, having sensed on closer inspection that Letho had used a substance to only make it appear that he died.Letho of Gulet was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins.

She was one of the few sorceresses able to polymorph, and was thought to be ""no less than three hundred years old"" by 1267.[1]She led the Thanedd coup against the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, intending to neutralize suspected traitors allied with Nilfgaard. Later, she helped found the Lodge of Sorceresses and is considered its leader.She was one of the victims of the Witch Hunts, having been tortured and killed by Archpriest Willemer's men. Many years later, she was exonerated and canonized as Martyr Saint.Even though Geralt never met this sorceress face to face, her name appears in conversation then and again. It is also speculated that either she or Keira Metz was speaking with Triss Merigold through the latter's magic mirror at the very beginning of Chapter III.Philippa Eilhart maintained quarters in the dwarven town of Vergen, which she used to share with her ""lover"" and apprentice, a ""leashed sorceress"", Cynthia, as well as a house in Loc Muinne. Geralt first had an encounter with her at the end of Chapter I, using Síle's megascope while investigating the disappearance of Triss Merigold, if he aided Iorveth before the fight with Letho.Her nightstand in her Vergeni quarters is highlighted when the Witcher's Medallion is used, though it seems inaccessible.Philippa Eilhart was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins.

In the quest Return to Crookback Bog, Geralt found a doll with obvious signs of black magic performed by the crones used to control the person this doll represents. The feathers on this doll immediately reminded Geralt of Philippa, but there was no definitive proof that the doll in fact represented her.She contacted Margarita Laux-Antille, explaining her plan to regrow her eyes by cultivating tissues on precious stones, just as Vilgefortz did, and to revive the Lodge. Then she went to Novigrad to seek help from her former lover, the sorcerer Arthur de Vleester. Having humiliated him in the past, de Vleester convinced her she'd be safer in her owl form, and then attached a dimeritium band around her ankle. Following de Vleester's execution during the witch hunts, Philippa fell into the possession of Zoltan Chivay, who affectionately named her Poppy.He later lost her to Sigismund Dijkstra, who made the mistake of removing her dimeritium band, and she returned to human form and attacked. Only Geralt's intervention put an end to her rampage. Philippa was then recruited to help stop the Wild Hunt in exchange for amnesty from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. After Margarita was rescued from Oxenfurt, she and Philippa met with Ciri to offer her equal partnership in the Lodge, to which she declined.Philippa later assisted Geralt in seeking out the Sunstone to help in their plan to lure out the Wild Hunt. While searching through the Skellige caves, Philippa criticised Geralt for having an overprotective attitude towards Ciri, stating that the Lodge were not a pack of wolves he could scare away with his sword, to which the witcher insisted that he could because they were. Once they found the Sunstone, Geralt assumed that she would take the artifact for herself, but Philippa insisted that that was not the case. She then revealed her intentions: to take Yennefer's place at Emhyr's court and become Ciri's advisor, and hoped Geralt would take Yennefer with him and leave everything to her."

"279","Radovid V","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Radovid V the Stern (Polish: Radowid V Srogi) was the king of Redania from the Redanian Dynasty in the last quarter of the 13th century. His reign became, along with witch hunts, one of the defining factors of the post-war period that followed the Peace of Cintra. Radovid was a polarizing figure: a brilliant strategist and a superb general by some, a paranoid madman by others. There were also many who took the middle view of his policies being harsh but justified.He inherited his titles and estates as the only son of King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore. His two older sisters were Dalimira and Milena. Even though his father died in 1267, Prince Radovid didn't succeed him immediately because he was only twelve at the time and for several years the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council under influential Duke Nitert and Count Sigismund Dijkstra, the then-spymaster of Redanian Secret Service.Radovid bore a deep aversion towards mages that stemmed from his father being secretly assassinated by an unknown elf at the behest of the sorceress advisor Philippa Eilhart,[N 3] who then pulled strings from behind his back, ruled in his name and dominated and demeaned him throughout his youth.Radovid was born in 1255 in Tretogor to the royal pair, King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore, as their third child. He grew up with two older sisters: Dalimira, informally known as Dalka, and Milena, who was known as Milka in a similar fashion. Dalka eventually dedicated her life to the priesthood after her failed engagement with King Foltest of Temeria, who instead chose to marry his own sister Adda, while Milka attended Aretuza to become a sorceress Millegarda.[2]When Prince Radovid was 9 years old he was formally engaged to Cirilla, Princess of Cintra, when she was 12. The engagement was formalized between his father and Queen Calanthe, Ciri's grandmother, but the king broke the engagement off after half a year without giving any explanation and Ciri and Radovid never even had a chance to talk to each other.[3]On the day of the outbreak of the Second Northern War with the Nilfgaardian Empire, his father had unexpectedly fallen victim to an elven assassin.[4] A fact unknown to practically anyone was that it was Philippa Eilhart, at the time fighting on Thanedd Island, who hired the elf in order to gain more direct rule. Redania fell into chaos, as usually happens in such circumstances, and Queen Hedwig was not in a state to control things.[N 3] The aristocracy started to organize itself into factions, attempting to tear some land out for each and every one of them. Several practically licked the boots of Nilfgaardian emissaries led by Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen and were ready to rule with Nilfgaardian blessing, only to be caught off guard and stopped by the famous Redanian Secret Service. There remained but a handful of those who were spared, those with important enough social status and armed might to maintain peace, like Duke Nitert.[4]Nitert was put in charge of the Regency Council appointed to save the realm from a total civil war and they managed to do so, by hanging everyone they deemed traitor in specially modified fortifications with internment camps - most infamous of which would be Drakenborg. Its members, however, overlooked their underage crown prince and none of the Northern Kingdoms' elites, not even Philippa who took it upon herself to raise him, expected him to grow into a firm monarch who would repay all humiliations he and his mother had suffered during the interregnum.A young but decisive, unrelenting King Radovid V's deed quickly earned him the epithet of ""the Stern"".[5]He began his reign by taking care of various nobles who ruled on their lands rather independently from Tretogor. He proved a capable political actor, manipulating events to the advantage of both his own position and Redania's. He utilized Redania's famed spy network to foster links with multiple potential allies, picking and choosing as he saw fit while ensuring those discarded were destroyed. In all his political actions, he attempted to embody the idea that a king should be ruthless towards his foes and generous to his friends.[6]King Radovid meeting Geralt for the first timeLooking to secure relations with Temeria, Radovid made his way to the kingdom's capital of Vizima in 1270. However, while there he eventually came into contact with Salamandra through some ""mutual acquaintances"" and thought he could make use of the criminal organization but ultimately concluded not to do so. Despite this, the witcher Geralt of Rivia happened across some of the criminals communicating via a mirror with the king, who only revealed he wasn't backing the group before closing off communications with the witcher.[7]Eventually, though, his hideout was discovered by the witcher. The two conversed for a bit, with Radovid revealing why he was in Vizima before asking the witcher's opinion on Adda the White, who he was seeing as a possible way to combine the two royal families. The two then parted ways.Back from Temeria, Radovid V began to gather his armies and erect fortresses. To counter the sorceresses' rising power, he invited the Order of the Flaming Rose to Redania and granted them lands.[8] He made several military reforms, espousing the idea that a soldier was only as good as their breastplate. He ensured that his armies were well-equipped, allowing his quartermasters as much gold as was needed to keep his infantry in solid armor. Aware that human soldiers were neither as strong as dwarves nor as dexterous as elves, identified their key advantage: their numbers. A mass of humans, led by a capable of commander, could overwhelm an individually superior force. His final military philosophy concerned the effectiveness of heavy cavalry, and he would suggest that any battlefield problem could be overcome by a gallant charge. These tactics would see him through several successful military campaigns, culminating in a subjugating nearly the entirety of the Northern Kingdoms and the defeat of the invading Nilfgaardian forces of Emhyr var Emreis' third invasion.[6]In July 1271, Radovid came to the deliberations at Loc Muinne, followed by a number of regular soldiers and knights of the Flaming Rose who were meant to ensure that peace talks remained peaceful, as well as step in if things did not go Redania's way. Shortly after arriving, the King imprisoned Phillipa Eilhart with the help of Nilfgaardian delegation. To avenge his father, he had her eyes gouged out and meant to execute her before she escaped.[8]When the Third Northern War broke out, Radovid remained the only monarch to have the strength to resist Nilfgaard. Taking advantage of this, during the winter break, he invaded a weakened Kaedwen and absorbed the Kaedwenian Army into his own. He also had Temerian partisans[9] and Kovirian mercenary companies at his disposal,[10] and considered utilizing the Crescent Moon, an influential independence movement in the Nilfgaard-conquered Nazair.[11]However, both Radovid and Emhyr had set their eyes on Novigrad, as whoever controlled the free city would not only have control over the ports, but its hefty treasury as well, therefore making victory likely for the one who gained control of it. To try and weaken the city for his taking, Radovid employed the services of Whoreson Junior, one of the ""Big Four"" of Novigrad's underground crime bosses, enticing him with money and a grand estate in Oxenfurt in return for turning on the other bosses and bringing about their downfall.His plan worked to a degree, but once it was clear that Junior had outlived his usefulness, Radovid decided to reveal his location to Geralt - who sought revenge on Whoreson Junior for unrelated reasons. However, Radovid took advantage of this and called upon Geralt for a favour; while onboard his flagship, the HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor, Radovid asked the witcher for his help in finding and apprehending Philippa Eilhart.  	 		 		 		 			Radovid V as winner of war in Novigrad 		 	Radovid V as winner of war in NovigradIn the end, Radovid managed to defeat the invading Nilfgaardian forces, winning the Third Northern War. With this victory, Radovid absorbed all of the North - including Novigrad - into his own empire, resulting in him being known as the ""Protector of the North"".[9][6]Perhaps the most defining feature of Radovid's reign was his policy of relentless witch hunts. All over the North, groups such as mages, non-humans, herbalists and soothsayers were burned at the stake in mass numbers. Radovid seemingly lived up to an elderly age[6] and was remembered in the history as Radovid the Stern.[5] Many listed him alongside Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart as one of the key people responsible for the witch hunts.[12]  	 		 		 		 			Philippa stabbing Radovid 		 	Philippa stabbing RadovidSometime later on, while his ship was anchored in Novigrad, Radovid was approached by many others claiming to know where Philippa was, but seeing through these lies, he dealt brutal punishments to the deceivers, from having them blinded, their tongues and fingers cut off, or drowned. Geralt subsequently approached him, claiming to have found her location: St. Gregory's Bridge. After being provided proof in the form of Vizimir's ring, which Philippa had used to pass decrees in the late king's name, Radovid and his soldiers set off for the bridge at once.However, the king turned on the witcher, claiming that he irritated him, and ordered his men to kill him. The witcher was ultimately saved by the timely arrival of Temerian guerrillas, who ambushed the area and thusly caused Radovid to flee. At the last house, the monarch banged on the door to open up, but was stunned when Philippa opened the door to greet him; the sorceress then proceeded to blow powder in Radovid's face, blinding him and leaving him in agonizing pain, before she thrusted a dagger in his back, killing the king.[9]A beverage known as Redanian Herbal was called ""stern"" in honor of Radovid.[7]Radovid's Journal image"
"280","Ravanen Kimbolt","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Ravanen Kimbolt (born c. 1206)[1] was a Temerian aristocrat who, along with Boussy and Anaïs La Valette, became chief claimant to the throne in Vizima after King Foltest's assassination in April 1271. An old style magnate, he commands loyal forces in numbers so large that only a few of his countrymen can match him, among them his rival, Count Linus Maravel. He separates those around him into the nobly born and common folk, paying little attention to the latter - unless he has temporary use for them. Proud and gruff, he considers political power his birthright and has no patience for those who stand in his way. After the torture of both Aryan and Maria Louisa La Valette failed, Ravanen ordered a band of mercenaries to ambush a caravan with the royal bastards. The mercenaries never showed because Maravel, unaware of Kimbolt's attempt, diverted it, accidentally killing Boussy in the process. When Geralt managed to reveal Maravel's betrayal to Nilfgaard, Constable John Natalis arrested him immediately. Provided that Geralt also revealed Baron Kimbolt's plan to kill Boussy, the witcher was awarded the Medal of Distinguished Service to Temeria but Kimbolt wasn't arrested as Natalis didn't have the manpower to command both men's units. However, with the new information he was able to blackmail the aristocrat into helping him out.He also apparently ordered a Kimbolt Way to be constructed in Velen, directed towards Oxenfurt, meant to act as a safe escape route in case his plans to take power after his cousin's death went awry.[2]"

"284",NA,NA,NA,NA," Geralt of Rivia","Roach (Polish: Plotka) is the name that Geralt of Rivia, the witcher, gives to all of his horses. His preference is for mares.The name refers to the roach (Rutilus rutilus), a common European fresh water fish. It has nothing to do with the cockroach, and nothing directly to do with the either the French given name ""Roche"" or the character Vernon Roche. Though the English term for the fish (""roach"") does in fact share its origin with ""Roche"": both terms come from the French word for ""rock"".It's worth noting that the original name for the horse in Polish is ""Plotka"", a diminutive form of the word ""Ploc"" (meaning ""roach""). Diminutives are endearing in Polish, so a more direct translation would have been something along the lines of ""Roachy"" or ""Roachie"".Moreover, the Polish word is female gendered which corresponds with Geralt's preference for mares - it would be odd for a stallion to be called ""Plotka"". The tender tone as well as the gender of the name is lost in the translation.However, ""Plotka"" has another meaning which is ""small fry"". In the Polish version of the third game, this is brought up during Broken Flowers if Geralt beats Morvran Voorhis in a race, who will praise him by saying ""Impressive rider skills from someone for whom every horse is a small fry."" In this meaning the name becomes gender neutral, thus can be used for a stallion as well.Horse combatThe horse Geralt owned throughout the game is named Roach. There is a number of equipment available for Roach: saddles, saddlebags, and horse blinders. Saddles let Roach gallop full speed longer, saddlebags increases Geralt's inventory limit, and the blinders decreases the rate that Roach's fear level rises.In a contrast to the previous games, trophies gained from contracted monsters appear tied to Roach's saddle instead of on Geralt's person. If Geralt visits Emhyr after he finds Ciri, and does not accept the coin offered, when he leaves he is granted a black Pure Bred Nilfgaardian thoroughbred stallion. After this event, whenever Roach is called, a black horse appears instead of the original bay mare."

"288","Saesenthessis Human form Dragon form","Dragon","Female",NA,NA,"Saesenthessis, commonly known amongst people as Saskia the Dragonslayer or the Virgin of Aedirn, was a dragon with the ability to take on the form of a human. She was a key player in the battle of Vergen and depending on the outcome, queen of the independent realm of Upper Aedirn.She was the daughter of the famous golden dragon Villentretenmerth and the green dragon Myrgtabrakke.She was born when the famous Hunt for a Dragon occurred, in which a group consisting of various individuals tried to hunt down and kill her mother, a green dragon named Myrgtabrakke. The little hatchling was in grave danger after the group poisoned Myrgtabrakke until a golden dragon, Villentretenmerth, appeared and, with a little help, defeated the attackers. It turned out that the hatchling was the golden dragon's child and, after thanking those who helped him, he left with his newborn.[1]Villentretenmerth raised the little dragon and taught her everything he knew, including his views on various topics such as the equality of all life, justice, and honor. She was given the name Saesenthessis and she accepted her father's views as her own. Because she was a cross-breed, her mother being a Green dragon and father a Golden one, she inherited the skill of polymorphism, though in her case, it was extremely limited - she was only able to take one alternate form, that of a beautiful human maid.However her ""childhood"" did not take a long time and soon her father left her on her own. Though that might sound harsh, it was actually a common practice among dragons. So young Saesenthessis began to travel the world alone.Saesenthessis in a form of human warrior, Saskia the DragonslayerOn her travels, she met an Elven commander of a Scoia'tael unit, Iorveth. Not much is known about their meeting but they respected each other. It was Iorveth who gave her the idea about her fictional alias and thus she took a human form and adopted the name Saskia. They came up with her entire history - she was from Aedirn and there she fought and killed a dragon, giving her the moniker Saskia the Dragonslayer. She was active in the kingdom of Aedirn, where she attracted many folks of different race and stock. Her ideals about freedom and equality lured the oppressed from far away who soon started to call her the Virgin of Aedirn.She eventually moved to the city of Vergen in the Pontar Valley. Here, she created quite a unique city where dwarves, men, and elves lived together as equals. Though things looked great initially, a tragic event soon occurred where King Demavend III, Lord of Aedirn, was assassinated. While the late king's son, Prince Stennis, was in place as Aedirn's heir, another king, Henselt of Kaedwen, decided to take advantage of the disarray and sent an invasive force to the Pontar Valley with the intention of annexing it. Thus the prince and his noblemen joined forces with the Dragonslayer and came to the city of Vergen.Saskia and Prince Stennis dealing with King HenseltAround this time, a different conflict occurred. In Temeria, King Foltest laid siege on La Valette Castle. Saskia knew the young lord Aryan La Valette and agreed with his views on equality so she left Vergen and flew to the battlefield to help him. She attacked the invading forces of the king but after a while she was driven away, but not for long. She returned and attacked with wrath, almost burning alive the king himself. He was saved in the last moment by the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who pierced his silver sword into her maw. This injured her enough and she left the battlefield and returned to Vergen.Not long after, she was invited along with Prince Stennis to negotiate with the invading Henselt. As expected, the negotiations were not easy and eventually ended up in a duel. This duel however was interrupted when the King killed a monk named Olcan and his blood activated a dormant curse.During that moment, a duo entered the field - a witcher Geralt of Rivia and Scoia'tael commander Iorveth. They quickly came to help and fought all the spectral knights and a few draugirs but whenever they killed one of the spectral foe, other appeared. Fortunately, they received help from a magical owl that shielded them and safely guided the group through the spectral mist thus the dragon, the prince and both warriors came safely to the city of Vergen where it was revealed that the owl was none other that the famous sorceress Philippa Eilhart. Saskia during The War Council, drinking from a dwarven ceremonial chalice, just a second before falling unconscious due to effects of ThaumadorIt was soon decided that a war council should assemble to deal with the curse and the coming of the Scoia'tael unit led by Iorveth. Though the members of the council were not happy to see Iorveth, whom they considered a mere bandit and murderer, an agreement was eventually reached. Unfortunately, when Saskia raised her chalice for a ceremonial toast, she fell down unconscious - poisoned. Philippa discovered that the poison was Thaumador, called also Magepain. This was very dangerous and Saskia's life hung by a thread. The sorceress took her into her care and prepared a list of various ingredients that could cure the Virgin of Aedirn. Thus the famous witcher started his quest to cure the Dragonslayer. Meanwhile, Iorveth decided to leave Vergen and find more elves to join the fight.As always, Geralt was successful and eventually acquired all the necessary items needed for the cure, including the petal from a rose of remembrance. Philippa used all the items and was able to heal Saskia though for a time, she was very weak and had to rest. Around that time, the witcher also lifted the curse on the battlefield. With the cursed mist gone, nothing stood in the way of the invasion and Henselt did not want to waste any more time.In the end, it turned out that it was Olcan who poisoned her.When Geralt woke up from the deep sleep caused by the process of lifting the curse, Vergen was already prepared for a battle. Saskia told the witcher what should he do and where should he help so as always, he did. The defending forces fought bravely at the main gate and with the witcher's help killed many invaders but they were simply outnumbered. That is why they decided to use a burning oil to massacre the first wave and then they retreated to the second gate. Invaders soon regrouped and led by the sorcerer Dethmold, quickly advanced to the gate and beyond it.Here, Saskia fought side by side with the witcher and they repelled one wave after another. However Saskia received information, that a group of Kaedweni soldiers and Dethmold found the way to the mines and wanted to use them to attack Vergen from behind. Thus Saskia decided to take Geralt and go to the mines. Here they were ambushed by Dethmold and his men. The duo was outmatched and was almost defeated. Saskia had no other choice so she changed to her true form. The dragon quickly defeated all the soldiers - excluding the sorcerer who fled via portal - thus saving the witcher. She told him the truth about her origin, and the need for the ruse with the whole Dragonslayer story. She also confirmed that it was indeed her, who fought at the La Valette castle and who was wounded by a witcher's sword. Geralt decided to keep her secret and they returned to the surface and rejoined the battle. With a return of Iorveth and his archers, the battle was won and invaders repelled. The king was brought before the Dragonslayer and the sorceress Philippa to hear the conditions of a surrender.Saskia declared an independent kingdom of Pontar Valley with herself as its Queen and Philippa as her advisor. Henselt agreed that he would recognise the state and Saskia as its ruler and sweared that he will not invade again. After that Saskia demanded one additional thing - execution of the sorcerer Dethmold. Henselt had no choice but to consent and thus the mage was decapitated. After the execution, Saskia released the king and along with Philippa left for Loc Muinne where a great meeting of the northern kingdoms was taking place.The execution of Dethmold however was not unnoticed by Saskia's people and especially Iorveth, who never thought she would take a life of a prisoner without due process. Iorveth believed that Saskia behaved strangely so he and the witcher decided to search Philippa's house for any evidence. They indeed find the recipe for the Thaumador poisoning that did not included the Rose of remembrance and discovered that by adding the petal, Philippa spell-bounded Saskia's will to her own. In essence, Saskia was controlled by Philippa.That angered Iorveth who decided to travel to Loc Muinne and confront the sorceress. As usual, the witcher went with him.In this version of events, Geralt arrived at the scene of the duel in a different company. That of the commander of Temerian special forces Blue Stripes, Vernon Roche. Together they joined the forces of king Henselt and with the sorcerer Deathmold, they managed to get through the spectral mist safely to the Kaedweni camp.The witcher had to lift the curse with the same items and in order to do it, he had to visit the city of Vergen. During his pursuits, he was able to meet Saskia herself, who offered him a place at her side. Unfortunately, he was forced to reject her offer. When he managed to acquire all the items, he was able to lift the mist and thus opened a way for the king to finally attack the city.After a series of events at Henselt's camp, Geralt and Roche joined the battle for Vergen on the side of the defenders. However, the defending forces were quickly outmatched and after a while, the battle was lost and Henselt emerged victorious. But he did not managed to capture either Saskia, or her advisor, sorceress Philippa Eilhart, as the duo fled to the Loc Muinne via portal.Not long after arriving to the city of Loc Muinne, Phillipa was arrested by the king of Redania, Radovid V the stern. Saskia was not able to help her mistress and retreated with another sorceress, Síle de Tansarville, an ally of Philippa. Thanks to the spell, Saskia was very anxious and wanted nothing more than to help Philippa but Síle told her to wait and be ready for the Summit itself.Iorveth and Geralt arrived to the city before the summit only to find out, that Philippa was arrested. They decided to find her and persuade her to lift the spell from Saskia. The witcher managed to discover, that she was kept in the dungeon under control of Redanian forces. The sorceress was interrogated there by the Radenian king himself and he let her eyes to be gouged out. Blinded Philippa was discovered by the Witcher, who quickly defeated all the guards and then turned to the sorceress herself.If Geralt decides to help Philippa: Geralt decided to help the sorceress to get to her house with promise, that she would give him a magical dagger, that would lift the spell from Saskia. He managed to get her home, but as was expected, Philippa turned on him. The witcher not only ended up surviving, he also managed to aquire the promised dagger. Thus he was ready to join the Summit.If Geralt decids not to help Philippa: Geralt argued with blinded Philippa, but ultimately, decided that saving his lover and friend Triss Merigold is more important and thus instead of Philippa, he captured a Nilfgaardian ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. Philippa was left on her own and had to manage herself.Saesenthessis attacking the Loc Muinne SummitIf Geralt kills the dragon: The witcher decided that letting the dragon live was too dangerous thus, he ended her suffering with a powerful strike from his sword, ending the life of great Saesenthessis.If Geralt spares the dragon: The witcher decided that he would stay by his code and will not kill such a magnificent creature as a dragon. He simply left her and returned to the city.If Geralt lifts the curse: Geralt used the opportunity and decided to lift the curse. He stabbed the dragon with the magical dagger and caused it to transform to her human form. Saskia recovered from the spell as well as the wound she suffered and she thanked the witcher. She told him more things about herself, including the fact, that her father was none other then the Golden dragon Villentretenmerth, who Geralt met and befriended many years ago. The duo said their farewell and departed each to a different place, Geralt returned back to the Loc Muinne and Saskia to Vergen.The dragon's attack on Loc MuinneIn this version, Geralt arrived at Loc Muinne in the company of Vernon Roche. He never discovered about Philippa nor had he met the Dragonslayer herself. That is, not until the summit itself in which Síle, after being exposed, summoned Saskia in her true form. The dragon caused chaos and quickly recovered her ally and flew with her away from the blaze. They were however followed by the witcher Geralt. Geralt eventually stood against the dragon and after a confrontation, was able to gain the upper hand, by anchoring himself to her with his steel sword. Saesenthessis attempted to throw the witcher but to no avail, the witcher eventually managing to send the dragon down to the ground, impaling herself on a broken tree. The witcher was then faced with another decision: to let the dragon live or not.If Geralt kills the dragon: The witcher decided that letting the dragon live was too dangerous thus, he ended her suffering with a powerfull strike from his sword, ending the life of great Saesenthessis.If Geralt spares the dragon: The witcher decided that he would stay by his code and will not kill such a magnificient creature as dragon. He simply left her and returned to the city.[2]Saskia in the comic bookNot fully recovered from Philippa Eilhart's spell, Saskia (while in dragon form) unintentionally killed a group of dwarfs during the first expedition against the Chelonodrake. Come morning, she, once again in human form, returned to Vergen and swore before all the inhabitants never again to transform into a dragon.Three weeks later, Saskia and Yarpen Zigrin talked to Geralt about the Chelonodrake and convinced him to help them slay the monster. Five days later she, Geralt, Eggar, Maevarienn, and Yarpen created a plan to kill the monster.Two days later, the group, accompanied by Barclay Els, went on the final expedition against the Chelonodrake. After defeating the monster, Saskia broke her promise and transformed in to a dragon to get the heavily wounded Barclay to the dwarven medics quicker. Unfortunately, she brought him in too late, and so she decided to leave Vergen.Some time later, Saskia found Geralt in a jungle and they had a chat around a campfire and she ultimately decided to return to Vergen to help the residents fight off the incoming Nilfgaardian forces. However, during the beginning of the Third Northern War, the Nilfgaardian Army quickly conquered all the northern territories up to the Pontar river, including Upper Aedirn, and thus Saskia's independent realm met its end. While it was implied that Saskia never made it out of Vergen alive,[3] she in fact retreated and, for the remainder of the war, stayed alive and well.[4]Saskia was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA."

Aedirn had good spies, so they were ready for them, and Seltkirk lined up his troops under the banners of Vengerberg, Aldersberg and Gulet along the hills. They decimated the Dun Banner and wreaked havoc among the Kaedwenis. Aedirnian hearts rose at the mere sight of his shining white armor.Vandergrift cut Seltkirk off from the rest of his army.

He, along with his brother and fellow witcher, Auckes, took part in the attempted assassination of King Henselt in the Kaedweni camp near Vergen. Even though he was unsuccessful, he was not killed by Geralt like his brother and managed to flee the scene, only to be later found and disposed of by Síle de Tansarville to cover the Lodge of Sorceresses' role in the regicides.After Geralt saved Letho's life in Angren, the witcher helped him find the Wild Hunt who had kidnapped Yennefer. Serrit and his brother Auckes formed part of the party of witchers that were tracking down the Wild Hunt.In the winter solstice of 1270, at an event that would come to be known as the night of magic, Serrit took part in the battle of the Hanged Man's Tree where the witchers faced the riders of the Hunt. Although the witchers fought bravely, they could not kill them all due to being highly outnumbered. A stalemate was reached and after an exchange had taken place (Geralt for Yennefer) the riders took off and the remaining witchers left with Yennefer in tow.After her return, Yennefer was feverish, delirious, in agony, and suffering from amnesia. Out of respect for Geralt, the witchers took care of her until she was better. However, Yennefer turned out to be quite a handful, trying to seduce Auckes to drive a wedge between the witchers and causing the group endless trouble in Nilfgaard, a kingdom known to have strict rules on mages that could result in her being killed for her unruly behavior. To try and protect her, the group wandered through the provinces of the empire pulling Yennefer out of whatever trouble she would find herself in until one day they got caught by the imperial secret police.They were questioned separately, but no violence was used. After the interrogations, Letho got an offer from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself: kill as many northern kings as he could, and in recompense, the emperor would rebuild the School of the Viper; Letho agreed and recruited some of his fellow Vipers into the task, thus creating a group that would be remembered as the Kingslayers. Like his comrades, Serrit was initially affiliated with Iorveth's band of Scoia'tael and received sanctuary from them in-between assassinations.[1]Serrit was a formidable swordsman, preferring to use two short blades in combatLater, Serrit and his brother were tasked with assassinating Henselt, the king of Kaedwen. After making their way through the Kaedweni lands, the brothers made their hideout in a network of caves located near the Kaedweni camp and spent their time there, waiting and planning.The day of the strike they cleared some harpies outside the cave and proceeded to met with Letho. After a short conversation about the presence of Geralt in the Kaedweni camp and their next move, the witchers set out on their mission. They used the time they had in the walk towards the camp to discuss the events that were to go down at Loc Muinne.After infiltrating the Kaedweni camp, Serrit secured the palisade while his brother took care of the ground floor. The witchers met by the cave entrance and once there they killed the knights protecting the king. Serrit then came into Henselt's tent and slit the throat of the messenger there, only to be confronted by Geralt; unfazed, Serrit attacked, but failed as Geralt used the sign of Aard to expel him from the tent. Auckes joined Serrit, resulting the witchers being forced to fight their former companion. While Auckes was cut down by Geralt, Serrit decided to flee after narrowly avoiding attacks from Síle's magic and successfully escaped to the hideout.[1]Serrit before dyingAlas it was to no avail, for Síle tracked him down to deliver him a painful death in an attempt to cover up the Lodge of Sorceresses' hand in the regicides. Geralt, who was on the kingslayer's trail, managed to find the Viper clinging on to life. With his dying breath, Serrit confirmed Geralt's suspicions about Síle's involvement, offered an apology for leaving him behind at the Hanged Man's Tree and began to discuss how close they got to vanquishing the Wild Hunt and freeing the world from the omen of war. The witcher succumbed to his wounds shortly after.[1]Serrit was a lot more hot-headed than his brother, complaining about the lack of action they had in the past days and being anxious to assassinate Henselt, claiming it would be an easy target due to his recklessness. He also didn't seem too troubled by the fact that the king also had a sorcerer and a witcher in his retinue, despite the latter being Geralt. Pragmatic as his brother, he cared little about the life of Triss Merigold and Síle and advised that they should be killed to prevent them from revealing their plan.He seemed to held Geralt in high regard, thinking of him as a skilled fighter, a friend and a man who could teach him about life in general, this is reflected in the Notes of the kingslayer named Serrit. He also shared an affection for bear traps with his brother. According to a Scoia'tael prisoner in the Kaedweni camp, Serrit was very proficient in Elder Speech, much more so than Geralt."

Even other members of the Lodge feared her, with perhaps the exception of Philippa Eilhart, Francesca Findabair, Assire var Anahid, and Yennefer of Vengerberg. Unlike her colleagues, Sheala was not known to interfere in politics and instead dedicating her days to research. She even resigned her seat with the Council of Wizards because it interfered with her work. Sheala liked to dress in a strict, black velvet gown trimmed with pearls and often wrapped a silver fox boa around her neck. Queen Zuleyka of Kovir once sought her magical assistance in getting her son away from the evil influences of the ""bad crowd"" he had fallen in with.

The child was to ensure the future and status of the Lodge. After the birth, Ciri was to become the Lodge's new member. They needed to invent a new surname for Ciri, so that their plan could work. Sheala offered Ciri to take hers, in that case she would be known as ""Cirila de Tancarville"", but she refused, preferring to be called ""Cirilla of Vengerberg.""When the Lodge decided whether or not to allow Ciri meet Geralt one last time, Sheala voted against it to teach Ciri discipline.Síle appears in The Witcher 2. In the English version of the game, her name is spelled ""Síle de Tansarville""; Síle is the traditional Irish spelling of the name. Geralt meets up with her in the town of Flotsam where he learns that she has been hired to rid the port of the dreaded Kayran.Triss and Geralt meet her after she successfully repelled the Kayran from the Flotsam harbour. The witcher discovers Síle knows him and notices the tension between the two sorceresses. They agree on hunting the beast together. In the meantime, the sorceress hires Zoltan Chivay to polish some diamonds she could use to build herself a megascope, an apparatus performing many complicated magical operations and enabling her to communicate with other sorceresses.When it comes to fighting the beast, Síle lures the kayran to the shore and help Geralt slaying it. She then harvests some rare ingredients from the corpse. As Philippa later claims, they were needed to cure Henselt's impotence and thus make the king trust a sorceress and allowing Síle to his court.It is no wonder then that after leaving Flotsam she is found by the king's side and attends the negotiations between prince Stennis and the Dragonslayer. When the mist of Sabrina's curse descends, de Tansarville defends the Kaedweni king and manages to escape with him and Dethmold back into their camp.During the quest ""Enter the Dragon"", she attempts to teleport away from Loc Muinne, unaware that her megascope has been sabotaged by Letho. Geralt can choose to remove the flawed diamond to save her life, or leave it alone causing her to be torn to pieces.If Geralt saved her life in The Witcher 2, Síle appears in the prison at Oxenfurt along with Margarita Laux-Antille. Síle's wounds from her capture are too substantial and inevitably causes Geralt or Yennefer to give her a merciful death."

"300","Siegfried of Denesle","Human","Male","Knight"," Order of the Flaming Rose","Siegfried of Denesle was the 2nd Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, serving from September 1270 to 1272.[2]As a young knight, Siegfried joined the brotherhood to fight against monsters and generally anything evil that might endanger the common folk. Since he was also a nobleman of some moral code and kind heart, Siegfried got along rather well with the witcher Geralt of Rivia and their friendship changed his life forever.Siegfried was born sometime in the 1250s to pious Sir Eyck of Denesle and his wife Sophia.[1] His parents raised him at Castle Denesle, teaching him knightly code of honor.At one point, a serious illness struck Siegfried's mother. He immediately ran to his father and implored him to earn coin for her betterment by demanding payment for next few beasts he would slay. Eyck, however, refused so as to not stain his reputation. This angered Siegfried so much that he renounced his father.[1]Later, when he joined the Order, a rumor began to circulate in the Trade Quarter of Vizima claiming he was secretly a bastard of Jacques de Aldersberg.[3]Siegfried first met Geralt in the Vizima sewers while they were both on the hunt for a dangerous cockatrice. The knight suggested that they join forces to defeat the beast and deal with drowners. After the cockatrice was slain, both Geralt and Siegfried were ambushed on their way to the surface by Salamandra agents. After these were defeated, Siegfried sarcastically asked whether they were friends of the witcher's, then on a more sober note mentioned a friend who might be of service in defeating this organization: Raymond Maarloeve, a private detective living in the Temple Quarter just above the sewers.Siegfried then spent most of the following days at his post (if he and Geralt joined forces in the sewers, this is the Order outpost north of the Cloister; if not, it is at the front entrance to St. Lebioda's Hospital), at one point making a brief excursion to the swamp - but first, he waited by the gate to the dike in order to help Geralt past its guards. He could also be invited to Shani's party. Later on, he was moved before the Cloister's main entrance and advised Geralt on a couple of happenings.If Geralt has consistently supported the Order: Siegfried became a key ally to Geralt and started realizing that Jacques de Aldersberg is descending down a path of madness with mutated Greater brothers and other similar monstrosities designed to defeat both the Scoia'tael under Yaevinn and forces loyal to King Foltest.If Geralt has consistently supported the Scoia'tael: Siegfried became yet another fanatic who blindingly believed in words of the Grand Master and considered the witcher to be traitor, becoming his sworn enemy.[3]After the death of Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg, the Order de facto lost its ground in Temeria and parts of Aedirn. The Order's Supreme Council convened not long after and Siegfried was chosen as the next Grand Master.[2] The assembly also accepted King Radovid V's proposal to become a special force of Redania and moved to that kingdom's northern parts where they began to build Castle Barienmurg, the main stronghold of territories granted to them as well as one of the largest fortifications in the Northern Kingdoms.At this point, Siegfried still continued his monster hunting but due to an overload of work, he has done so sporadically. When summit of monarchs and mages was being prepared at Loc Muinne in July 1271, Radovid summoned Siegfried and his knights to oversee the security.Iorweth's path: Siegfried stepped in to allow Geralt safe passage into Loc Muinne through the Order's Camp, though Iorweth nevertheless had to find an alternate route.Roche's path: Siegfried vouched for both Geralt and Vernon Roche when entering Loc Muinne and meeting Radovid. Siegfried believed in Geralt's innocence regardless of the path the witcher has taken and also stated he owes Geralt too much to stand against him as well as talking about Radovid's ambition, the reformation of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and the Order's view on peasant rebellions."

"314","Triss Merigold","Human","Female","Advisor Mage"," King Foltest of Temeria Lodge of Sorceresses Temerian Royal Council","Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with the latter.[2] Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.Not much is known about Triss' upbringing. Not even a precise time of her birth, which is a subject to some degree of confusion - see below. What is known is the fact, that she was born and lived as a child in Maribor. Sometime during her childhood, she had a conduit moment and was noticed by sorcerers. Thus, she found her way to Aretuza. Here, she became a sorceress on her own, specializing in making of magical potions, mainly healing ones. This was rather amusing twist of fate as she herself was alergic to magical potions and could only tolerate non magical ones.After the graduation, she became a very well known and respected sorceress taking her assignment as a advisor to the throne of Temeria.During her studies, she befriended a fellow sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg. During 1249, which is a time when a story ""The Last Wish"" takes place, the two of them were already close friends and colleagues.Some time later, Triss found out about her friend's on and off relations with Geralt of Rivia. Curious about the nature of that relationship, she used a magic and seduced the witcher, resulting in them spending time together in Kaer Morhen as lovers. During those time, Triss became very good friend with some of the other witchers, Vesemir and Eskel. The former liked her so much that he started to call her ""little daughter"". Since then, she was always welcome in the witcher's keep.After some time however, the spell faded and Geralt simply ended the relationship. This proved to be a very difficult for Triss as she fell in deep love with Geralt. Despite that, the two of them remained very good friends in years to come and even though Triss was still unhappily in love with him, he did not wish to start anew.When the Great War with Nilfgaard started and the Kingdom of Cintra was destroyed, sorcerers under the leadership of Vilgefortz of Roggeveen decided to stand with the North and manned an old Elven ruin on Sodden Hill. Here, they wanted to stop the invading forces. Triss was among those who volunteered. The battle was brutal and the mages stood against incredibly strong forces but in the end, they managed to defeat the invaders. The cost of victory was high, though, as 13 mages died. As a matter of fact, it was first believed that the number of dead was 14 - the last one being Triss. She was very seriously wounded, not only sustaining a deep cut on her chest, but also having all of her hair burnt off. With Yennefer, the only mage that would have still recognised her, blinded during the battle, she was counted amongst the dead.When Geralt rode near Sodden some time later, he saw the memory stone erected in remembrance of those who gave their lives to protect the North. Triss was among them, which saddened Geralt very deeply. When it was later discovered that Triss had indeed managed to survive the battle, she became known as ""the fourteenth of the hill"".Not long after the battle, Triss received a message from Geralt, asking her to come to Kaer Morhen, to help him with his Child of Surprise - Ciri. Ciri was trained by the witchers, yet she started to show some strong magical abilities that were beyond what was conventional for witchers. Thus, Triss accepted and went there, but she was reluctant to be near Geralt again as her feelings for him had not faded. During her stay, she constantly struggled with the way she felt but she eventually managed to clear her mind and do her job. Ciri, as she discovered, was a young lady with sad history and the two of them took liking to each other instantly. Their bond was so strong that Ciri started to consider Triss her older sister and vice versa. Some disquiet between Triss and the witchers surfaced when Triss discovered that the witchers want to submit Ciri to special potions. While not as invasive as the Trial of the Grasses, the potions would still cause harm to her body and most likely leave her barren. She begged them not to give her those, and eventually they agreed.The other problem was that Ciri slowly became a woman and, being only girl in the keep, she had nobody to ask about specifics that comes with that. When Triss discovered that Ciri had no idea about her own cycles and that the witchers were unaware of them as well, she was furious. Since then, whenever Ciri came in dress, the training would stop until she change to the training attire.More problematic, however, was her increasingly strong proficiency with magic. Witchers told Triss, that since Ciri came to the keep, she had 3 incidents where she spoke a different voice in unrecognizable language and had trance - like state. In the last one, she also foretold the death of Geralt. They said that the first time it happened was after Ciri accidently drunk a potion, the same potion, that now stood before Triss. When Ciri came, Triss tricked her into drinking said potion to the shock of all the witchers. She told them however, that she knows what she is doing. Ciri started to dance and not long after fell into a trance. Triss teleptaically connected with her and tried to find out what is the problem. While connected to the young girl, she felt a strong presence inside her. Triss used all her power and identification spells but it all proved futile. This battle of wills proved very draining and Triss passed out.Later, she woke in her bed with Geralt next to her. He told her that she was out for six hours and ensured her that Ciri is alright and sleeps in her room. The sorceress told Geralt that whatever bounds with Ciri is way too powerfull for her and that he should contact Yennefer, who is more knowledgable about such things. Geralt was reluctant, considering their past, but Triss insisted it would be the best for the girl. After Geralt agreed, Triss told him that when spring comes, they should take Ciri to the Temple of Melitele. The witcher agreed and then spent the night with the old friend, taking care of her.Next few months, Triss spent every day with Ciri and tought her various topics, including the Elder Speech. But she also showed her a delicacy of make-up. As the spring neared the witchers were slowly preparing to go on the path once again and they wanted to know all the relevant news from the continent so to decide where to go.Triss told them everything she knew and they eventually talked about the possibility of second war with Nilfgaard. This resulted in a heated debate about witchers and their neutrality.That night, they decided that with the morning light, they will go to the temple.Triss, along with Geralt and Ciri went on the way. Not long after, Triss became ill, having very strong stomach ache. Her illness was worse and worse to such a state, that she was not able to hold herself in the saddle. Thus Geralt had to carry her on his horse. But even with that, they were slow and had to stop for the sorceress to relieve herself.Eventually they arrived to a village. This however proved not a good sign, because the settlement was attacket by elven commandos of Scoia'tael. Triss was laid down with the other wounded while Geralt went to find out what are their options. He learned about the attack and the planned retaliation. However he knew, they have noone, who could cure Triss. What was worse, the men started to think, that Triss may have some infection that could spread. Even though Geralt told them, that mages cannot have an infection due to their immunity, and that it had to be a case of food poisoning, they did not want her there.Thus the trio was forced to go on. Fortunately, Geralt learned about a convoy that went the same way as they need to so they rode to them. There they discovered that in the convoy was an old friend, dwarf Yarpen Zigrin. Geralt persuaded Yarpen and a knight in charge of the convoy to allow the trio to join them. Triss was laid to one of the vagons but her state was still very severe. She was no longer able to relieve herself on her own and Geralt had to carry her into the woods. Other dwars watched this with a surprise. They were not sure if they would do the same for their own wives. When Ciri told them, that Triss and Geralt were not couple but friends, they could not believed it.They continued of the way and Triss started to feel better. But she was still very weak thus Geralt and Ciri had to help her with bathing and clothing. As a matter of fact, despite her state, Triss rather enjoyed Geralt holding her so tightly and caring for her.Sometime later the convoy was approached by soldiers from Kaedwen. Those soldiers warned the men that Scoia'tael are near so they should continue very carefully. Not long after that, the elves indeed attacked the convoy. Triss was thrown out of the vagon and had nasty wound on her head. The attack was swift but the defenders managed to repel it. By that time, Triss was well enough, to be able to take care of the wounded and help them with her magic.The rest of the journey was without any incident and they succesfully arrived in the temple. Triss then went on her own giving her farewells to both Ciri and Geralt.Triss is a major character in The Witcher computer game. She is one of the first people Geralt meets after being found unconscious in the woods by his fellow witchers.She is also the one to nurse Geralt back to health after his first battle with Azar Javed in the Swamp. Once Geralt regains consciousness, he finds himself in the bedroom of her luxurious Trade Quarter home, and he sees her talking presumably to another sorceress. She diligently ""checks him for internal injuries"".For the main article, see The Witcher romance.PrologueDuring the prologue, after dealing with the Salamandra invasion of Kaer Morhen, Triss is gravely wounded and needs a special potion which Geralt must brew to help her recover. If not rushed during the dialogue, after drinking the potion, she offers Geralt his first sexual encounter of the game.Chapter IIIIf it was Triss and not Shani who was chosen to take care of Alvin the second romance option becomes available if she is given a ruby ring, and in regards to Alvin, Geralt must be strict at least once.Triss plays a major role throughout the story. She first appears in the prologue as Geralt's lover; her feelings for him have evidently remained unchanged. Triss assists Geralt and Foltest in taking La Valette castle. She gets separated from them when a dragon attacks Foltest's forces. After Geralt is imprisoned for Foltest's murder, she meets up with him and Vernon Roche before they set sail for Flotsam, having lost her position as advisor after Foltest's death. In Flotsam, she meets with fellow Lodge member, Síle de Tansarville, and becomes suspicious of her presence. She helps Geralt prepare to fight a kayran by introducing him to Cedric, finding the Kayran's lair, and helping him create a potion to allow Geralt to resist the beast's poison. After Geralt meets Letho, Triss and Cedric break into Síle's room and Triss uses the megascope to try to gain more information on Síle (by speaking either to Dethmold or Philippa). Shortly after, Letho abducts Triss and forces her to teleport them to Vergen.In Vergen, Triss gets away from Letho and tries to make contact with Philippa. She finds Philippa's room, but comes upon Philippa's apprentice, Cynthia, there instead. Cynthia, a Nilfgaardian spy, captures Triss using Artefact compression, and smuggles Triss across the mist of wraiths, where Triss eventually makes it into the hands of Nilfgaard's ambassador, Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. Before Geralt can rescue her, Shilard takes his ship to Loc Muinne.In Loc Muinne, he commissioned the help of Assire var Anahid to decompress Triss. Triss is restrained and interrogated for more information of the Lodge. If Geralt chooses not to save her, in favor of helping Roche or Iorveth, a massacre erupts in Loc Muinne, with opposing forces fighting not only one another, but also mages after Nilfgaard revealed the Lodge's involvement with the Northern regicides. In the chaos, Letho saves Triss from the Nilfgaardian camp, and takes her to the now abandoned Temerian camp and protects her until Geralt arrives after fighting the dragon. Once Geralt reaches the camp, Triss steps away, while the two witchers talk.If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss, he breaks into the Nifgaard camp and eventually finds her restrained and asks her about the Lodge and their influence behind the Demavend and Foltest's murders. When Geralt and Triss go to the amphitheater, Triss reveals Síle's role in the assassinations, allowing Carduin to reject Síle from joining the reformed Conclave of Mages. Triss and Geralt are separated again when Geralt goes to fight the dragon, and they meet up shortly afterwards, where Triss tells Geralt that Letho is waiting for him. On their way to Letho, Triss explains that mages helped prevent further bloodshed in the city. Regardless whether Geralt rescued her or not, after Geralt confronts Letho, he leaves Loc Muinne with Triss (and maybe with Roche or Iorveth).For the main article, see The Witcher 2 romance.Triss is the default romance option - the game begins with her and Geralt already in a relationship. One of three opening scenes of Geralt's story during the prologue shows him getting up as Triss lies naked beside him as a messenger soldier enters their tent to summon the witcher to the King Foltest's side.The first real opportunity arises near the end of Chapter I during the quest The Rose of Remembrance. When given the option to go to the elven baths, Geralt can choose to take the sorceress along with him. After a battle partway through the quest, the ground under their feet collapses, sending the two plummeting into ancient elven baths. Noting that an immediate escape is impossible, the two can take advantage of their location. Selecting the correct conversation options will initiate a cutscene, in which Triss completely takes off her clothes with magic and jumps into the water. Our Witcher soon joins her in the bath. After the lovers enjoyed one another well enough, Triss comments this short time of bliss in such a manner: ""We should take walks more often. For a while there, I forgot all about Flotsam, the Scoia'tael, the kingslayer, the whole world really..."".Since March 31, 2015, Triss Merigold is a new playable character in the MOBA ""The Witcher Battle Arena"".Triss returns in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as the leader of the mage underground due to the witch hunt begun by Radovid V. Her appearance did not change much but interactions with Yennefer prove quite interesting. There is also a free DLC which gives Triss an alternative outfit.After the events at Loc Muinne Triss and Geralt (who had now regained his memory) separated. Triss decided to go to Novigrad, which many mages believed to be a safe haven, and set up a shop in the city center. The Eternal Fire religion in the city, however, declared all mages to be witches and traitors and began arresting and murdering them.Triss was forced to seek the protection of The King of Beggars to whom she paid 80% of her earnings whilst attempting to gain enough money to escape the city with her fellow mages. Geralt, upon arriving at the city, found Triss with the King of Beggars and assisted her ridding a rat infested mill. The Mill owner, however, sold her out to the witch hunters, and if not for the efforts of Geralt, Triss would have been captured.Triss accompanies Sigismund Dijkstra to Margrave Henckel's house to meet with Geralt, who was searching for Dijkstra's lost treasure; Triss agreed to stick her neck out in exchange for Dijkstra's financial aid in smuggling the mages out of Novigrad. After Geralt told Dijkstra that Caleb Menge, the leader of the witch hunters, had his treasure, and after the ex-spy had left, the witcher informed Triss that Menge had Dandelion imprisoned. To find Ciri, Triss then helped Geralt discover the location of Dandelion by allowing herself to be taken to the witch hunters and tortured whilst Geralt gained the information. Ultimately she kills her torturers before killing Menge.If Geralt assists Triss in spiriting all the mages under her wing to Kovir, it results in the witch hunters targeting nonhumans. Helping Triss ensures she goes to Kaer Morhen to fight the Wild Hunt. Before the Hunt's attack, she is happily reunited with Ciri, whom she provides with a magical stone that will call down a fireball that would strike down all her attackers except herself.Following the battle, Triss goes with Yennefer and Avallac'h to Novigrad to try and reunite the Lodge of Sorceresses, taking up residence at the Rosemary and Thyme, an establishment owned by Dandelion. Unfortunately, they had not much luck, as Ida Emean outright refused and Francesca Findabair wouldn't budge from her realm with a war raging.When Geralt later arrived, Triss berates him for putting Ciri in danger by taking her to the Sabbath to face Imlerith. Afterwards, she informed him that the only Lodge member she could locate was Philippa Eilhart, who was tricked into her owl form by Arthur de Vleester, who put a dimeritium band on her leg afterwards. Worse yet, Philippa came into the possession of Zoltan Chivay, who lost her in a card game. Luckily, Triss found a feather. Using hydromancy at the fountain behind the Passiflora and divined that Philippa was in the possession of Sigismund Dijkstra. They rush to his bathhouse, where Philippa, having regained human form after Dijkstra foolishly removed her dimeritium band, was wreaking havoc. After Geralt managed to subdue her, Triss led her colleague to safety.HugGeralt can reignite his romance with Triss in separate stages. While extracting Lady Ingrid Vegelbud's son from her estate past the witch hunters, Triss gets drunk, which leads to Geralt kissing her as the fireworks start. At the conclusion of Now or Never, if Geralt professes his love for Triss and kissed her previously, she seemingly departs on the ship for Kovir. But she returns, interrupting Sigismund Dijkstra's anecdote about his affair with Phillipa Eilhart. She asks to speak privately with Geralt at the lighthouse, where they have sex.While searching for Phillipa using hydromancy, Triss' spell in the reflection of the pool behind the Passiflora, changes to an unknown house. When pressed by Geralt, she reveals that King Tankred had offered her a position as his court advisor. She also reveals that the house is to be hers in Pont Vanis, where she wants them to live together after the Wild Hunt is defeated.If Geralt finds one of Triss' lost earrings in their bed back at Kaer Morhen, he can return it to her. During the epilogue, Geralt and Triss settle in far-away Kovir. Geralt would take jobs, more out of habit than need, due to the fortune Triss received as the advisor to Kovir's king. If Geralt romances both Triss and Yennefer, they trick him into thinking they're having a threesome, only to leave him tied to the bed in the Rosemary and Thyme.If Geralt romanced Triss in the main game, then she makes an appearance during Geralt's adventures in Toussaint.After the quest Blood Run, Geralt receives a letter from Triss that begins the quest Turn and Face the Strange.

In which case, he will say ""I vow on the love of my lady, Triss Merigold, to respect the chivalric virtues"".After the main questline for Blood and Wine is complete, Geralt can return to his home in Corvo Bianco and is surprised by Triss, who is waiting for him.

He can be found near the ruined bridge in Flotsam forests.The quest related to the troll is available with the DLC Troll Trouble.Geralt is contracted to deal with the troll living underneath the bridge east of Flotsam. The troll typically keeps the bridge in good repair whilst charging for its use, but of late it has taken to vodka, allowing the bridge to fall into ruin whilst still aggressively demanding coin off travellers who approach it. The village elder of Lobinden asks that Geralt attempt to reason with the being, rather than simply kill it. When it is confronted underneath its bridge, the troll attacks Geralt in a drunken rage. After it is wounded, it pleads for mercy. Geralt has the option of killing it, or hearing it out.If it is allowed to explain its behaviour, it says that it drinks in order to forget the memory of its mate, who disappeared recently. Geralt can offer to find out what happened to her in exchange for repair of the bridge. After asking around town Geralt finds the unfortunate she-troll's head afixed to Lobinden's tanner's wall. The tanner says he bought it off Dmitri the bandit, who is known to hang around the graveyard. If Geralt goes to the graveyard he finds Dmitri and his gang, dressing up the corpses of civilians as Scoia'tael and spies in order to claim large rewards from Loredo for them. Upon being asked about the she-troll, Dmitri and his men simply attack.If Geralt kills Dmitri, then returns to the troll and explains what happened, the troll promises to repair the bridge and to stop drinking.

Cautiously trying to look around the ship, the frozen parts began to shatter and the witcher ran towards them. Tybalt, being the closest to Letho, began to fire off arrows, but the first missed, instead shattering one of the frozen crew members. As he fired off a second, Letho deftly avoided it by spinning and the arrow grazed his back instead. Before Tybalt could fire again, Letho stabbed him in the gut, killing him.The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings - Intro"
"319","Vandergrift","Human","Male","Soldier Rank(s) General"," King Henselt of Kaedwen Kaedweni Army","Vandergrift, also known as the Visitor, was the general of the Kaedweni forces in the second war between Kaedwen and Aedirn.During that war, King Henselt's troops, including the dreaded Dun Banner, crossed the Pontar the third day after the autumn equinox. Aedirn, led by Seltkirk, had good spies however so they were ready for the Kaedwenis whom they proceeded to annihilate.Vandergrift cut Seltkirk off from the rest of his army. The two met in the middle of the melee. It was a battle of titans. In the end, the Visitor hacked Seltkirk and sliced the white knight from his head to his groin. A terrible death that sent the Aedirnian ranks into disarray.During the battle, Vandergrift's long simmering disdain of Sabrina Glevissig came to a head and the two argued bitterly which led the sorceress to retaliate by summoning Melgar's Fire and causing balls of fire to rain down on Kaedweni and Aedirnian combatants alike.Earlier, in peacetime, Seltkirk and Vandergrift had met at a tournament in Ard Carraigh. Seltkirk won then. Vandergrift's sword cracked and the Visitor had to yield. In response, Vandergrift had the smith who had forged the sword hanged, and commissioned a new sword forged by the best smiths and mages in Kaedwen. He named this new sword ""Loa'then"", meaning ""hatred"", and continued to wield this sword until his death on the battlefield near Vergen, where he was one of the approximately 3,000 soldiers burned to death by Sabrina Gelvissig's fireballs. Loa'then was later salvaged from the battlefield, and later came into the possession of Saskia the Dragonslayer, the leader of the Aedirnian resistance to Kaedwen's latest attempt to annex Upper Aedirn. Saskia later gave the sword to Geralt of Rivia to use to break the curse laid on the battlefield from three years earlier, during which Geralt fought and defeated Vandergrift in the form of a Draug.In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, Vandergrift only appears as the arch-wraith Draug.He was given the nickname ""the Visitor"" because he used to visit at night the inhabitants of a conquered city in their houses, calm them by assuring them they have nothing to fear, and then promptly cut their throats.[1]"
"320","Vanhemar","Human","Male","Mage"," Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen","Vanhemar was a Nilfgaardian fire mage, Cynthia's master, and personal sorcerer to Ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, whom he accompanied as part of the Empire's delegation.He died in a fight with Geralt when the Ambassador unwisely left him to ""finish off"" the witcher while the delegation fled to Loc Muinne to attend the summit."
"321","Vencel Pugg","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Vencel Pugg was an alchemist and generally shady character who asked Geralt to get him the formula for a particular type of incense which is manufactured and distributed by a vendor in Flotsam.He can be found hanging out near the docks early in Chapter I."
"322","Vernon Roche","Human","Male","Commando Rank(s) Commander"," Blue Stripes Temerian Army Foltest","Krzysztof Banaszyk (Polish)Vernon Roche was the commander of the Blue Stripes, special forces of the Temerian military. Being Temerian, he held his king, Foltest, in high regard. He was also a capable fighter.Vernon Roche never met his father. He spent his childhood living in poverty. Having no money to live on, his mother was forced to work as a prostitute on the streets. Because of that, other children used to fling insults at him, calling him ""whoreson""; since that time, Roche reacts aggressively to this particular insult.Vernon admits that, if not for King Foltest, he would have ended up on the streets either as a vagabond or a drunkard.Roche has served for four years with the Blue Stripes unit. For his devotion and efficiency he was decorated twice with the Order of Bravery.According to Iorveth, he is responsible for the annihilation of many elves, women and children among them. Roche also led the ""pacification"" of Mahakam.Because of his capability, he became Foltest's right hand man and had a great deal of power and influence in Vizima.In the prologue, he interrogates Geralt about Foltest's killer, and begins to believe that Geralt had nothing to do with the assassination of Foltest. An unnamed 'contact' later revealed as Dandelion provides information about the real Kingslayer's whereabouts.At the start of Chapter I, Roche, Geralt and Triss encounter Iorveth, who attacks them due to the ongoing hostility between the Scoia'tael and the Blue Stripes. After saving Zoltan and Dandelion, Roche and his men occupy a building next to the inn. While Geralt is off performing tasks, Roche continues his hunt for Iorveth and the Kingslayer, culminating in a three-way battle between the Scoia'tael, the Blue Stripes, and Letho. During this battle, Geralt has the option of freeing Iorveth and returning his sword or siding with Vernon and the Blue Stripes. Failing to help him leads to Iorveth's capture by Roche. If you choose to side with Roche in Chapter I, you will lead an infiltration attempt to kill Flotsam's corrupt and treacherous Commandant.In Chapter II, Roche is revealed to be behind a conspiracy against King Henselt. After the conspiracy is discovered, King Henselt on the advice of mage, Dethmold, orders the execution of the entire Blue Stripes, except for Ves, whom Henselt rapes. Geralt and Roche escape the Kaedweni camp to intercept Síle in Vergen, which is under siege by Henselt's Army. The Sorceress manages to escape the city but Henselt and his Royal Guard, who were also looking for her, are defeated by Geralt. Roche is then either convinced that killing Henselt would only aid the Kingslayers and make him just as much a murderer as they are or allowed by Geralt to kill Henselt in revenge for the execution of the Blue Stripes.In Chapter III, Roche is one of the few remaining men still able to act in the interests of Temeria, and seeks to prevent the dissolution of his country at Loc Muinne. Vouching for Geralt, he manages to get the witcher access to the city, past the Order of the Flaming Rose even if Geralt sided against them.Meeting with Radovid V, Roche discovers that Anaïs La Valette was captured by Dethmold and agrees to rescue her and deliver her to Radovid. If Geralt decides to aid him, Roche will either keep his word to Radovid and deliver Foltest's bastard child to him, in which case he dons the Redanian colors and declares he will serve Radovid as the latter turns Temeria into a protectorate believing it the best way to protect Foltest's legacy, or he will be persuaded by Geralt to send Anaïs to John Natalis, in which case he will do his best to protect her and Temeria will remain independent. Either way, Dethmold is brutally murdered by Roche.Should Geralt decide to save Triss, then Roche will successfully rescue Anaïs on his own but will be unable to kill Dethmold, in which case Temeria will either be divided between Redania and Kaedwen, if Henselt remains alive, or fall into civil war.In the immediate aftermath of the events at Loc Muinne, Vernon Roche raced out to the front line and joined the 2nd Temerian Army under Natalis' command where they held defensive positions on the Dol Blathanna - Mount Carbon line in preparation for the coming Nilfgaardian invasion. However, after three days, the Nilfgaardian soldiers smashed through their lines and the Temerians scattered. Upon hearing of King Radovid's call to arms near Novigrad and promises to fight for a free North, Roche took the remaining forces and fought through to the west, breaking into the Pontar Delta in the hopes of attracting Redanian support. Alas, to his despair, Radovid was no different from Emperor Emhyr and thus he turned to guerrilla warfare.Still wanting to secure a free Temeria, he struck up an alliance with former Redanian spymaster Sigismund Dijkstra and former Temerian spymaster, Thaler. Realising that Radovid meant no hope for Temerian sovereignty, the group began plotting his assassination. In addition, Roche began contact with Nilfgaard, who promised to make Temeria an independent, vassal state to the empire in return for killing Radovid and stopping guerrilla attacks on its forces. Thus, Roche had his men undermine Redanian support in the area while not attacking Nilfgaardian troops. Likewise, Nilfgaardian troops were also ordered to leave the guerrilla soldiers be, supposedly under the pretext that they weren't much of a threat anymore.When Geralt started looking for Whoreson Junior in the area, Dijkstra sent him to Roche, who was now camping out in a large cave near Oxenfurt. After conversing for a bit, Roche then informed Geralt he had some luck, as he was about to head out to speak to an informant who might know more about Whoreson Junior. In Oxenfurt, Roche showed that his informant was none other than King Radovid V. After a conversation with the king, Geralt and Roche then left, with Roche saying that Radovid was sinking further into insanity and asking for the witcher to drop by as he needed help with something.Later, after the mages successfully escape Novigrad, Roche meets Geralt in the Passiflora with Dijkstra. They reveal their plan to assassinate Radovid, and that a contact of theirs who is essential to the plan hasn't reported back; this contact turns out to be Thaler, the former Head of Temerian Intelligence.The personal matter that Roche needed assistance with turned out to be Ves, who was openly defying Roche's orders and attacking a Nilfgaardian encampment without his approval. If Geralt agrees to assist Roche, they find Ves about to ambush an execution of the citizens of Mulbrydale. After killing the Nilfgaardians and saving Ves, Roche and Ves get into an argument over her disobedience. Geralt can offer his opinion. While they argue, they find that a Nilfgaardian officer survived. The two argue over whether they execute him or not, and again, Geralt offers his input.If you helped Roche with dealing with Ves, he can be recruited to assist in the battle at Kaer Morhen against the Wild Hunt. Roche agrees, and says he will head over immediately, once he gets some important matters taken care of.When you return to Kaer Morhen with Ciri, you have the option to engage in dialogue with Roche and Ves about the keep, the status of the guerillas, and what they think the outcome of the war will be. If Letho of Gulet was brought to the battle, it will instead be triggered as an automatic cutscene. The conversation will proceed as normal, until Letho interrupts it, commenting he's found some ""old friends"". Roche and Ves are angry at Geralt for bringing the man who killed Foltest to the keep, and refuse to speak to him.Later, when Geralt goes to retrieve Philippa Eilhart, if he does not break Djikstra's leg, he can optionally take part in the assassination, alongside Roche his guerillas.If Radovid is not assassinated: Radovid's forces defeat Nilfgaard and all of the Northern Realms, including Temeria, are annexed by Redania. Roche's fate is unknown.If Radovid is assassinated: When Radovid goes to retrieve Phillipa as part of a ruse, he sentences Geralt to death, saying his sarcasm and dry wit irritate him, and that he's killed people for much less. When the executioner asks Geralt for ""any last words"", a Temerian guerilla strikes the soldier in the back with an arrow, after which Roche and his men attack. They battle Radovid's men until they find the king banging on a door. Philippa then appears, blinds Radovid and stabs him in the back, shocking Roche.They later meet at the theater, where they discuss their next steps. Thaler reveals the deal he had made with Nilfgaard to secure Temerian sovereignty, before Dijkstra arrives. Dijkstra reveals his betrayal, stating that the deal meant giving the rest of the Northern Realms to Emhyr and was unwise. He continues, angering Roche further by saying that he'll fight for the North and unite all the kingdoms under Redania after defeating the invader, as his henchmen surround the group. Relying on the Witcher's neutrality, Dijkstra persuades Geralt to leave."

Therefore, during the annihilation of her village by the Scoia'tael, she was spared and abducted by the commando's leader, as he had taken a shine to her. For several years, she was held prisoner by the commando. Eventually, Ves was freed by Vernon Roche and the Blue Stripes soldiers. After noticing her potential, Roche convinced her to enlist with the Blue Stripes unit.Ves is a skilled sharpshooter, and the lieutenant of Vernon Roche.Ves returns in The Witcher 3, aiding Roche in his guerrilla campaign against Nilfgaard although she is more radical, going as far as disobeying Roche's orders to protect those who helped them."

Then he started to spread the belief among soldiers, saying that Sabrina would protect them while in battle.He has surrounded his hut with a circle of candles, which curiously keep monsters away. He claims that it is Sabrina's blessing, but most likely it is that creatures do not like the fish oil smell.Talking with him, Geralt learns that the Visionary is the same soldier who speared Sabrina's body while she was on the stake, killing her. Unfortunately, this spear is lost."

When Priscilla was viciously attacked, she tried to help avenge the trobairitz as Priscilla had always treated her like an equal rather than look down on her like so many others.Going by the belief that attackers tended to return to the scene of the crime, she waited in the alley where Priscilla was attacked with some thugs when Geralt, who was also investigating into the attack, came along.

"330","Yarpen Zigrin","Dwarf","Male","Adventurer Dragon slayer Soldier"," Yarpen Zigrin's company Mahakam Volunteer Army","Yarpen Zigrin was a well known dwarven warrior, adventurer, and a dragon-hunter. He was the leader of a group of six dwarves and later a veteran of the Battle of Brenna.Not much is known about Yarpen's youth. It is known however, that he became a leader of his dwarven company which included Lucas Corto, Paulie Dahlberg, Regan Dahlberg, Xavier Moran, and Yannick Brass. This group traveled the Continent and hunted large and dangerous game.During that time, Yarpen and his company had apparently slain a dragon called Ocvist. Soon afterwards they traveled to Caingorn, where another dragon had been sighted and a hunt called. When they arrived in the kingdom, they joined the hunting party.Yarpen's group was just one of many parties participating in the hunt. Officially, the hunt was under the command of King Niedamir, but he did not really command anything. Other individuals joining the hunt were Knight Eyck of Denesle, Boholt and his Crinfrid Reavers, sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, witcher Geralt of Rivia, bard Dandelion, sorcerer Dorregaray, and last but not least, Knight Borch Three Jackdaws with his company of two Zerrikanian women (Téa and Véa). The target of the hunt was a large, female Green dragon that made a nest in the area. Shortly before the hunt commenced, the dragon was poisoned by some locals, and though seriously wounded, she survived.Thus the hunt begun. Very soon, Yarpen made a deal with Boholt about the dragon, the killing and mainly the share of the dragon's treasure. During the hunt, they encountered many perils such as a rock slide that almost killed the sorceress and the witcher but the two were saved by Eyck. They eventually reached their goal and stood face to face with the wounded dragon, but before they could attack another dragon appeared, this time a Golden dragon. Villentretenmerth, the dragon, used his telepathy and told the party he would fight them in a fair duel. Eyck of Denesle did not hesitate and swiftly attackeded but the dragon quickly defeated his foe and sent him, along with his horse, flying across the valley.After this, the King Niedamir decided to leave. However, the Reavers and Yarpen's group agreed they would still finish the hunt and kill the golden dragon. The hunting party argued, for Geralt, Dandelion, and Dorregaray did not want to kill such a beast and were against it. Boholt and Yarpen, along with their men, quickly defeated and bound all those who opposed them. The sorceress Yennefer, who at first appeared to side with the hunters, tried to use some spells against the hunters but was knocked off by Yarpen and tied up as well. With all the opposition tied up, Yarpen's and Boholt's men attacked the dragon.Though the golden dragon defeated them as well, the local militia arrived during the fight and attacked. The combined forces of all the men proved too much for the dragon and he began to lose. Fortunately, Yennefer, Geralt, Dandelion, and Dorregaray managed to free themselves and tried to defend the golden dragon. Likewise, Téa and Véa appeared and started to kill one man after another. Eventually, the defenders repelled the attackers and Villentretenmerth emerged victorious. He however forbade any more killing and thus the Reavers and Yarpen's group survived. It was then shown that the ""treasure"" the dragons were protecting so much was, in fact, a little hatchling. When the golden dragon, who was actually Knight Borch Three Jackdaws, left with his youngling, the entire hunting party dispersed and went their separate ways.[1]Around 1265, Yarpen and his company were still active, though they were one man short because Lucas Corto retired in Mahakam and married. They served King Henselt of Kaedwen and were tasked to deliver a convoy of secret cargo. On their way, they met a trio of travelers: the witcher Geralt of Rivia, sorceress Triss Merigold, and a young girl named Ciri. Geralt recognized his old mate and they asked to join them for a time being. The sorceress was very sick and was unable to take care of herself and so the witcher helped look after her. Yarpen noted how Geralt took care of the sorceress in a very kind manner and told Ciri never to make the same mistake as Triss, and confuse care and compassion with 'something else'.Despite helping King Henselt, the king didn't trust Yarpen and his dwarven company, believing all non-humans conspired with the Scoia'tael, and so the king had one of his soldiers tip off the Scoia'tael about the convoy so they'd attack the group to test the dwarf's loyalty. The company proved their loyalty as they attacked back, though a few of Yarpen's men died in the fight. Afterwards, on hearing that his men died because of his employer, Yarpen became enraged. At this time, Geralt's party left Yarpen's company, heading to Ellander and the dwarves continued on their own.[2]Later, when the Second Northern War begun, Yarpen fought against the invading Nilfgaardian forces. He proved to be a very skilled warrior and fought one battle after another, eventually standing in the last battle of the war, the Battle of Brenna. He survived the war and was present during the parade in Novigrad. However, his men most likely died during this battle since they were not present during any of Yarpen's adventures afterwards.[3]When Saskia the Dragonslayer began to rally folks under her banner with promise of independent realm where all will be considered equal, Yarpen joined and moved with her to the city of Vergen in Upper Aedirn. There he worked with other dwarven mates such as Skalen Burdon and Sheldon Skaggs. At first, all was relatively fine but then King Demavend III of Aedirn was assassinated. Even though he left an heir, his son Prince Stennis, King Henselt used the opportunity and invaded the Pontar Valley with the intention to annex it. Thus Stennis and his noblemen joined their forces with Saskia and moved to Vergen and Yarpen became a member of the War council.Saskia and the prince were later invited to negotiations with the king. Yarpen did not accompanied them and instead stood on guard near the city.If Geralt took Iorveth's path: There he met again the witcher Geralt, now accompanied by Iorveth and another dwarven friend of his, Zoltan Chivay. Yarpen was happy to see them but quickly noticed that Geralt acted like he had no idea who the dwarf was. Zoltan explained that Geralt suffered from amnesia and didn't remember a thing before he awaken near Kaer Morhen.Their conversation was cut short as they saw a powerful surge of energy emanating from the place of negotiations. Geralt and Iorveth quickly hurried there and discovered that King Henselt had murdered a monk named Olcan and released a dormant curse. The duo had to help Saskia and the prince get through the cursed mist full of wraiths. With help from a magical owl, they eventually managed to arrive safely in Vergen. There, a War council was summoned to deal with the news of the curse and Iorveth's arrival and eventually an agreement was reached and Saskia stood for a ceremonial toast. However, she fell to the ground once she drank from the chalice - clearly poisoned. Sorceress Philippa Eilhart, Saskia's advisor and the magical owl, discovered that she was indeed poisoned by Thaumador and now her life hanged by a thread.Philippa prepared a list of items and ingredients that would help her make a cure for the Dragonslayer. Meanwhile, Yarpen and his mates went to the local pub named The Cauldron and shared all news and happenings. They were soon joined by the witcher, who took it upon himself to find all the items Philippa needed. He also engaged in a friendly chat and even fought Yarpen in Arm wrestling but the situation was not easy so, after a while, they started to plan their next move. One of the items the sorceress needed was a special herb known as immortelle that grew deep below the surface. Local mines were an ideal place to look for it, but they were unfortunately closed because various filth infested them and made them incredibly dangerous. Yarpen, Sheldon, and Zoltan decided that they will accompany the witcher, provided he got access to the mines, so Geralt persuaded a local alderman Cecil Burdon to give them access. The group entered the mines and confirmed that the mines were indeed infested by necrophages. They killed every single one that they discovered, including their nests, as they moved deeper and deeper into the mine. After some time, they found the place where the herb was growing but the place was also the territory of a very dangerous and powerful monster, Bullvore. The group fought the beast and eventually killed it, allowing them to finally pick the herb. With it in hand, they returned to the surface and Geralt continued on while the dwarves retreated to the inn and continued their conversations.Yarpen and his men were a vital part of the defending forces and thanks to soldiers like them, Vergen emerged victorious, Kaedweni forces were decimated, and King Henselt was captured. After the battle, Saskia and Philippa left for Loc Muinne where a great summit was to be held while Yarpen stayed in the city.If Geralt took Roche's path: Geralt, accompanied by Vernon Roche, commander of Blue Stripes, joined the forces of King Henselt. Thus the witcher met Yarpen only during his quest to find the items needed to lift the curse. Yarpen, with Skalen Burdon, were guarding the Mahakam gate.[4]After the events at Loc Muinne, Saskia returned to Vergen and revealed that she was a dragon and, as expected, Vergen's residents had mixed feelings about it. Many abandoned the city and while others watched her actions closely.Not fully recovered from Philippa's spell, Saskia (while in dragon form) unintentionally killed a group of dwarves during the first expedition against the Chelonodrake. Come morning she returned, in human form, to Vergen and swore before all the inhabitants that she'd never again transform into a dragon or else she'd leave the area.Three weeks later, Saskia and Yarpen Zigrin talked to Geralt about the Chelonodrake and convinced him to help them slay the monster. Five days later she, Geralt, Eggar, Maevarienn, and Yarpen created a plan to kill the monster.Two days later the group, accompanied by Barclay Els, went on the final expedition against the Chelonodrake. After defeating the monster, in which Barclay was heavily wounded, Saskia broke her promise and transformed into a dragon to get hiim to the dwarven medics fast. Unfortunately it was already too late and she decided to leave Vergen for breaking her oath.[5]Not long after the hunt, the Nilfgaardian Empire attacked again, starting the Third Northern War. They quickly conquered all the lands up to the river Pontar. Fortunately, Yarpen managed to survive and during the rest of the war was alive and well - as mentioned by Geralt in Novigrad.[6]"
"331","Yennefer of Vengerberg","Quarter-elf","Female","Advisor Mage"," Brotherhood of Sorcerers King Demavend III of Aedirn Lodge of Sorceresses","Jenny[2]YenYennaHorsewoman of WarYennefer of Vengerberg, born during Belleteyn in 1173,[3] was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Supreme Council of Sorcerers within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.At some point, due to her magical potential, she was received in the Aretuza school for sorceresses, where rectoress Tissaia de Vries became her teacher and mother figure. During her training, Yennefer tried to kill herself by cutting both of her wrists, severing her tendons, though she survived. Tissaia claimed that the purposefulness of her attempt was the only thing that prevented her from feeling contempt for her weakness, and continued her training. In accordance with the sorceresses' tradition, any physical flaw, including her hunchback, was magically removed. Yennefer eventually graduated as a sorceress.[4]At some point, Yennefer set herself up in the town of Rinde and, ignoring King Heribert's rules that no magic users could stay in Redania, openly practiced her magic and provided her magical services to clients by staying with Novigrad's ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus granting her asylum from the law while in the ambassador's home. One morning, a witcher intruded on her sleep, revealing himself as Geralt of Rivia and that he needed her assistance in healing his friend, Dandelion, who had been afflicted by a djinn. After an initially rough greeting where Geralt responded sarcastically to her questions, Yennefer agreed to heal the bard, but she secretly made preparations in hopes of capturing the djinn, after Dandelion makes his final wish. When Geralt tried to stop her from using Dandelion, her spell took hold of the witcher, charming him to do her will against those on the town council who were against her. After Geralt is arrested, she has Dandelion, now awakened teleported out into town with instructions to make his wish to free Geralt. Yennefer tried to capture the djinn, but it fought her, destroying a good part of Rinde in the struggle, not knowing that the djinn's master was not Dandelion, but in fact, Geralt, who still held one wish. Geralt arrived to see Yennefer struggle with her spell, and he tried to stop her, leading them to fight one another. She got the better of him, and he revealed to her that he was the one with the last wish that could free the djinn. Geralt knew that the moment he made a wish, Yennefer would be too weak to contain the djinn and it would kill her. So Geralt saved their lives, by wishing their fates were tied together. Yennefer was grateful to the witcher, willing to bind himself to her, and the two began a relationship. TBAYennefer traveled to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander and spoke to Nenneke about a cure for her infertility. While she was at the temple, she spent time looking around for Geralt, and after discovering he wasn't there confronted Nenneke and ended up quarrelling with her, before leaving the temple.During the Battle of Sodden Hill she was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was later magically restored but she still bore the emotional scars.In May 1272, Yennefer sent Geralt a letter, arranging to meet in the village of Willoughby. However the village had been burned down, due to the Third Northern War reaching the region, so she headed through to the Nilfgaardian Garrison, passing through White Orchard in quite a rush. From the garrison, she headed to Vizima, meeting with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, concerning the location of Ciri. After a while, she heard Geralt was in White Orchard looking for her, so the sorceress rode with a Nilfgaardian escort to the White Orchard inn where she found Geralt and Vesemir. The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though she was nearly a century old. Yennefer had locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hung a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.Yen had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes she wasn't tall, was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs.She always dressed in black and white, at times wore stockings, wore frilled panties but never wore trivialities with underwire, she didn't need to. Her voice was resonant and mildly derisive. Her overall feminine shape was one of a twenty-year-old girl and she moved with a natural, unforced grace. She was a quarter-elf (meaning she had a quarter elven blood, in her case on her mother's side).It is implied that her attractive looks were a product of magic and had been acquired during her training, as with most other sorceresses. Geralt notes how her shoulders are slightly lopsided and by the end of the story realizes that Yennefer used to be a hunchback. Nevertheless, his love for her does not diminish.[6]Official The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt promo artwork by Marek MadejYennefer does not appear in the first game. During its events (year 1271), Yen is 98 years old. However, she is indirectly mentioned on several occasions.Yennefer in The Witcher 2 (flashback)Yennefer appears in flashbacks in the second game.In an optional encounter at the very beginning of the game Geralt (still without his memory) meets the Crinfrid Reavers where they mention that they were intending to rape the sorceress and not him (during the events of Sword of Destiny). Despite this they fail to remember her name believing her to be called ""Connifer"".In the end of the game it is revealed, that Yennefer is probably alive, but has amnesia like Geralt, and that she is located somewhere in Nilfgaard.Also, if the player decides to prevent Síle de Tansarville from being torn to bits, she will tell Geralt where to search for Yennefer.Yennefer was a playable hero in the now defunct MOBA, having been added with the Season 2 Update on 29 June 2015. Her alternative skin was called Ravenlord's Embrace and one of weapons was called Dark Moon weapon.In the third game, Yennefer is one of the main characters, and is voiced by Denise Gough. Her face was originally intended to be based on a 3D scan of Polish model Klaudia Wróbel,[7] however after initial in-game tests, the developers decided to reshape the face in order to give Yennefer a colder and meaner look.[8] Her first appearance is in the opening cinematic, wherein she is escaping from a battle between Nilfgaardian and Northern forces. Having recovered most of her memory, she has agreed to the serve Emperor Emhyr's interests in the hunt for Ciri. There is also a free DLC which gives Yennefer an alternative outfit.Yennefer had a note delivered to the witcher Geralt of Rivia stating that she needed to meet him urgently. Yennefer had given them a location to meet her, however the village was destroyed forcing her to flee towards White Orchard where Geralt alongside another witcher Vesemir lost her trail. Unknown to the witchers, Yennefer had then gone to Vizima, however as they had asked the nearby Nilfgaardian garrison commander for information about her location, the captain informed Yennefer of this. Knowning the witcher would be Geralt, Yennefer travelled to meet him immediately before taking him to Vizima to meet Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. En route, they are ambushed by the Wild Hunt, who slay their Nilfgaardian escort, before Yennefer destroys a bridge to prevent the Red Riders from pursuing them.As it turned out Yennefer had learned from the emperor that Ciri had returned to this world and that the Wild Hunt was pursuing her. After Geralt's audience, Yennefer explained that she had been using all manner of spells and rituals to try and track Ciri, only to alert the Hunt to her efforts. Therefore, she decided to rely on more conventional methods by turning to the best tracker she knows. She agreed along with Geralt to search for Ciri. She decided that he would search Velen and Novigrad for her whilst deciding to investigate Skellige herself.While on SkelligeGeralt later rendezvoused with Yennefer in Skellige during King Bran Tuirseach's funeral, where she explained that she suspected Ciri to be behind a cataclysm on the eastern end of Ard Skellig but Ermion, another of Ciri's tutors, refused to let her access the site, until they spoke with Crach an Craite. Afterwards, Yennefer and Geralt attended a wake at Kaer Trolde, where they stole the Mask of Uroboros, which possessed the ability to see the past events of the place it is viewed it. Upon arriving at the devastated area, they were confronted by Ermion, who warned them that it could only be used once and that using it will bring a cataclysm upon Skellige. As Geralt argued with Ermion, Yennefer went deeper into the devastated area and activated the mask, which caused a storm. Geralt ran to Yennefer and, using the mask's power, they found a place in the area where the elven mage had disintegrated a member of the Wild Hunt, then opened a portal and fled with Ciri. Ermion arrived soon after, and the two told him what they have found out. Ermion revealed to them that the Wild Hunt was recently seen on Hindarsfjall, so Geralt and Yennefer went there to investigate.Upon arriving to Hindarsfjall they went to the village of Lofoten, where the women were performing a ritual. Yennefer and Geralt interrupted them and asked about the Wild Hunt and Ciri. They were told that Ciri has been in the village, and that she was seen with a man they referred to as Craven. The two of them were in the stables right before the Wild Hunt arrived and attacked the village, killing many of its inhabitants. When asked about Craven, the women said that he went to the sacred garden near the village to defeat Morkvarg, some time after the incident, so Yennefer and Geralt went there to find him. In the garden, they found a body, and Yennefer decided to use necromancy to make it speak.The man's real name was Skjall. From what the body said, they learned that Ciri left with the elven mage on a boat as they were being chased by the Wild Hunt. Later on, Uma arrived on the same beach. After hearing the whole story, Yennefer forced the body to go back to its dead form. Yennefer's usage of necromancy drained all the magical power from the sacred garden, which the villagers of Lofoten didn't take lightly, and they blamed Yennefer and Geralt for not respecting their customs and beliefs. Still, Yennefer didn't care much about villagers' opinions, and she and Geralt ignored their claims. After leaving the garden, Yennefer asked Geralt to meet with her in Larvik, another village on Hindarsfjall, if he wanted to help her with something.Geralt met Yennefer at the inn of the village, where she told him she wanted to tame a djinn that belonged to a mage who sank his ship near Larvik harbor. They searched around the bay for the wreckage, until Geralt found a large crater on the bottom of the sea, and half of a seal inside it. He returned to Yennefer on the boat at the surface, and they concluded the mage asked the djinn to teleport him somewhere, which caused a part of the ocean's surface to teleport as well. Yennefer used the part of the seal to open a portal near the other half. Upon going through the portal, the two of them found themselves on top of a mountain, with the wreckage laying nearby.At this point, Yennefer confessed to Geralt that she needs a djinn to remove Geralt's last wish, which was to bind the two of them forever, so that she could see whether they truly love each other or if they are together because of the magical bond. The player can decide how Geralt would feel about this. Going through the wreckage, they found the other half. Yennefer connected the pieces which summoned the djinn. After a battle, they tamed it, and Yennefer commanded the djinn to remove the magic between her and Geralt. After this, they decided to sit on the edge of the ship, and Yennefer confessed to Geralt that she still has feelings for him. At this point, the player can decide whether Geralt also keeps his feelings for Yennefer or if he is no longer in love with her. This choice doesn't affect gameplay as much, but it is crucial to the ending itself, and Geralt's fate.After sitting some time on the edge of the ship, Yennefer opened a portal to her room at the Kaet Trolde inn, and they returned there. They knew Uma (also known as 'the ugliest man alive') was somehow important to finding Ciri, and assumed that it is probably a human, but under a curse. Yennefer decided to go to Vizima to report to the emperor, while Geralt went off to get Uma. Afterwards, they were to randezvous at Kaer Morhen and decide what to do with the cursed being.As Geralt was on his way to Kaer Morhen with Uma, he was intercepted by Nilfgaardian soldiers, and brought to Vizima to report to Emhyr himself. Yennefer was also there, and the two of them explained to the emperor what they found out and what their plans were. Afterwards, Yennefer teleported to Kaer Morhen, while Geralt went there on his horse with Uma. Upon arrival, she started ordering everyone around, ordering Eskel to collect forktail spinal fluid and for Lambert to imbue the phylactery with Power from the Circle of Elements.Subsequently, she attempts to contact Ida Emean via megascope but some interference cause her three separate megascope crystals to explode. When Geralt arrives, she has him search for the source of the interference, which turns out to be dimeritium bombs created by Lambert, which Yennefer suspected he planted out of spite. With that out of the way, Yennefer successfully contacted Ida, who translated the Elder speech riddle to be as old as the Aen Undod.In order to lift the curse, Yennefer reveals that she intends to put Uma through the first half of the Trial of the Grasses and to use a prolonged magical treatment on Uma to reconstruct his original body piece by piece. Using the phylactery Ciri had repaired, they were able to contain the curse. Uma is revealed to be a transformed Avallac'h, the elven Sage who helped Ciri, who revealed where their young ward was hidden.Yennefer was finally reunited with Ciri after so many years, but the happy reunion was short-lived, as the Wild Hunt descended on Kaer Morhen. Yennefer participated in the battle by putting up a magic barrier to force the Hunt's navigators to open portals outside the fortress.In the aftermath of the battle, Yennefer decided that they needed to reunite the Lodge of Sorceresses and managed to work out a deal with Emhyr, with the promise of amnesty and asylum for the Lodge if they help defeat the Hunt. She and Triss traveled to Novigrad to search for Margarita Laux-Antille and Philippa Eilhart respectively.Yennefer later met with Geralt at Crippled Kate's to wait for the one man who escaped Deireadh prison, who then panicked, assuming the both of them to be bandits and ran off. They managed to catch up with him and clear up the misunderstanding. Returning to Kate's, the escapee explained that his knowledge of herbs enabled him to use mushrooms growing inside his cell and belladonna to fake his death, tricking the witch hunters into throwing him into the corpse pit, which led to the sewers.Yennefer then devised a plan for Geralt to infiltrate Deireadh through Oxenfurt's underground elven ruins and provided him with a device to signal her to teleport in once he had found Margarita. However, she could only teleport Margarita out, forcing Geralt to find another way out on his own.The Witcher 3- Wild Hunt ""The Trail"" Opening Cinematic"

Using his prior knowledge of herbs, Faria faked his own death by consuming a mixture of sleeping mushrooms, which he found growing on the walls of his cell, and belladonna, which he harvested in the prison yard. Despite the fact that this mixture was indeed life-threateningly toxic, Faria drank it one day anyway, an hour before the guards' evening rounds, given that, as he later stated in retrospect, he preferred to die on his own terms were that to be his fate.After his seemingly-dead body was discovered, Faria was thrown into a pit, as was the prison's procedure for handling cadavers at the time.

Once he'd recovered, he immediately asked her to marry him and the couple appeared to be happy and soon welcomed a baby girl, Tamara. Shortly after she was born though, Phillip was sent to Cidaris to fight in another war, this time to aid King Ethain on King Foltest's behalf. As he was seldom home, Phillip turned to drinking and soon become so dependent on it, he couldn't stop drinking even when he was home. Anna, either due to loneliness or not able to put up with her husband's drinking or a combination of both, soon turned to a childhood friend, Evan, for comfort and for about 3 years had an affair with him while Phillip was away.Eventually, Anna decided it was best to leave Phillip completely and one day packed up and took Tamara with her to Evan's, leaving a note behind for Phillip to let him know she was leaving. Upset, Phillip followed her to bring her and Tamara back. However, still enraged, Phillip ended up killing Evan, upsetting Anna, who proceeded to yell and claw at him before picking up a knife and trying to stab him. Phillip moved out of the way just in time and, not knowing what else to do, beat her. This event marked the change in their relationship to an abusive one.Later, during the Third Northern War, Phillip moved the family to Crow's Perch where Anna made a small garden to tend to, and while Phillip tried to put on the air of a happy family, abuse still went on and by 1272 Anna was pregnant again. Extremely desperate to not have another child with the man she hated, she made a pact with the Crones where she'd be in their service for a year if they would do away with the unborn baby.

Soon after Phillip, drunk once more, flew into a particularly mad rage and fought with Anna before passing out. Anna ended up miscarrying right there but she and Tamara decided that was their best chance to run and quickly ran to meet up with Voytek. However, in their haste, Anna didn't realize she'd dropped her talisman during the fight, her only protection against the Crones. As the two women rode for the fisherman's home, the Crones sent a fiend after Anna, grabbing her and carrying her back into Crookback Bog.The Crones soon put Anna's pact to use, having her take care of the orphans at the bog. However, due to a combination of the Crones magic and the stress of all that'd happened the night she miscarried, Anna's mind became addled and her hair went white, though she was sane enough to take good care of the children, who only knew her as Gran. At one point Johnny, a godling living in the area, also befriended her and the children and would drop in time to time and sing to her.Sometime later that year, Geralt dropped by in his search for Ciri, but not trusting strangers, Anna tried to get him to leave. However Johnny, as a favor to the witcher, dropped in and was able to convince her to help Geralt and so she went and arranged a meeting of sorts, where the Crones spoke through her, informing Geralt to go help Downwarren's ealdorman and then they'd help him out.If Geralt did Return to Crookback Bog: "

When all the possible candidates put themselves forward, including Crach an Craite's two children, she tried to convince the jarl of an Craite to tell his children to back out but he refused.Deciding she had no other option, Birna schemed to remove all the other throne candidates by enlisting Arnvald's help in spiking the feast's drinks with a mixture of blood and mushrooms and then sent her son away from the main hall.

However, Svanrige realized she sent him out of the hall before the attack and asked the jarls if they would give credence to a man who turned on his own mother. This caused Birna to inadvertently admit her guilt, prompting the jarls to sentence her to death.

When the ritual was finished the two confronted the druid, who explained the vildkaarls willingly executed the massacre at the feast so that they could support their king but refused to name him and a fight breaks out. After defeating the druid Geralt found a letter on his corpse, unsigned but confirming Geralts suspicions that the vildkaarls were only working for someone.If Geralt doesn't help Cerys or Hjalmar: Birna negotiated without the jarls' consent to pledge Skellige to Nilfgaard and continued to speak for Svanrige despite him being named king. The diplomat from the Empire then asked for the new Skellige king to say the pledge himself, and Birna turned to her son.

With crown passed to Eist, the bond elevated into a personal union.After an interregnum following King Eist's death, Bran regained the iron crown of Skellige and ruled for a few more years. Once he felt too old, Bran set out to hunt a bear and died.Born in 1192,[N 1] Bran had two siblings, brother Eist Tuirseach and a sister who later gave birth to his nephew Crach an Craite.[3] As a member of Clan Tuirseach, Bran eventually inherited the title of the jarl of An Skellig and thereby the clan's leadership.After the previous Konung died, Bran submitted his candidacy and proved himself worthy by slaying a dragon named Evren. The display of valor won the hearts of the jarls, and Bran was given the crown.[2]Bran with the honor guardKing Bran united the clans through the way unknown to his predecessors: compromise. He invited his rivals to banquets and with sweet words, coin, and barrels of mead persuaded most to join his side.[4] During one such feast, warrior Uve Jabberjaw got drunk and insulted the king. Angered, Bran let Uve live but ordered him to tear out his tongue and therefore retain honor.At some point, Bran had met the love of his life Birna who, although not his first nor last lover, had always been closest to him and had become the mother of his firstborn son, Svanrige Tuirseach.[2] To keep rivals in check, King Bran was aided by his wife, who told him every suspicious rumor or deed that she had noticed during the feasts.[4] Aside from her, King Bran had druid Mousesack as an advisor and confidant. His brother Eist who by then rose to be the jarl of Skellige, commander of the armed forces, was an advisor as well.[3]When Queen Calanthe of Cintra set up Pavetta's 15th birthday feast in 1252, would-be suitors arrived. Bran sent his nephew Crach an Craite with Eist, Mousesack and Draig Bon-Dhu as an entourage but the event turned out unexpectedly. While Crach didn't win Pavetta's hand, Eist married the queen.[3] Bran was pleased with the result as it seated the remote islands at the same table as the mightiest dynasties of the Continent.[5]Despite his wife's repeated requests, the King refused to champion their son Svanrige as rightful heir to the throne. He perceived the concept of hereditary monarchy as preposterous and believed that the boy would earn the crown himself was he worthy.[4] By 1257, the crown has been bequeathed to Eist while Crach became the new jarl of Skellige.[6] The reign of his brother and Queen Calanthe, titled Ard Rhena (High Queen) on Skellige, lasted for over ten years until they died fighting the Nilfgaardian Empire.[7]After a brief interregnum during which Jarl Crach an Craite was effectively the steward of the Isles, leading the Skelligers against the Black Ones,[8] Bran was reinstated as the king.[9] For the next few years, Bran continued to rule as before, keeping the clans under him and leading them on profitable raids. Nevertheless, he never united the jarls as one massive fleet which could seriously threaten Nilfgaard.[2] Bran's reign was marked by continuous peace and he was given an epithet of ""the Conqueror"".[1]Bran on his final voyageBran lived long and reached 80 years of age in 1272. When his hands began to tremble and his ideas wandered off mid-sentence, Bran decided to go into the woods of An Skellig to hunt a great bear armed with only a knife and dressed in delicate cloth, leaving the world on his own terms.[4]His body was put on a drakkar in Kaer Trolde Harbor by Tuirseach warriors with all items he could need in an afterlife. When everybody bid him farewell, his young lover willingly lay next to his body as the ship was set out to sea and set ablaze by his nephew, Jarl Crach. One shepherd sacrificed his best mare for the king, while a group of An Craite warriors offered Bran their manes, swearing to remain bald until a new king had been chosen.[2]The specter of BranOn the same day, a wooden bust of Bran with detailed trimming was carved out by the harbor's artisans to be put up on the shore of Larvik where, the islanders believed, its fierce gaze would protect them from Nilfgaard.At the wake in Kaer Trolde citadel that ensued straight after the funeral, Bran was recalled as a hero by all present. Holger Blackhand remembered him fondly for keeping Birna in line and hoped for the next king to be his equal. With toasts raised to his memory, there were still likes of Cerys an Craite who felt Bran did little to resolve old quarrels.To prove himself a worthy candidate to the crown, Blueboy Lugos set out to best his fears in the Cave of Dreams. He took along witcher Geralt of Rivia and two warriors, Uve Jabberjaw and Jorulf the Wolverine. Inside, Uve saw specters of Tuirseach warriors and Bran. As his fear of insulting Bran once more came true, Uve had to defeat the warriors before he could continue.[2]Bran was also commemorated as a leader card in Skellige Gwent deck by Igor and Martin Monnier, counts of Toussaint inspired by their visit to the isles sometime prior to 1275.[10]Unlike the other jarls and konungs of Skellige, Bran knew how to use compromise to his advantage. In his early years, hospitality and friendly demeanor enabled him to easily win over any opponent and turn him into his vassal.[4] However, by the end of his reign, memory began to fail Bran and he could no longer unite the clans to pose a serious threat to the Nilfgaardian Empire.[2]Bran is a leader in the Homecoming version."

He was well known and respected (more accurately, feared) in the city as he maintained law and order through any means necessary. He was generally suspected of using torture, extortion, and blackmail, and often helping himself to confiscated possessions.He later succumbed to a heart attack while a doppler happened to be near and, seeing an opportunity to both survive in the city and make things better, the doppler took on Chappelle's appearance without anyone else knowing the real one had died.Geralt was visiting Novigrad when he, Dandelion, and Dainty Biberveldt were trying to figure out what to do about Dudu, the doppler that'd been impersonating the halfling, when Chappelle approached with his armed guards. Not knowing why a witcher was in the city, Chappelle took the witcher aside under the pretext of asking how much he could be bought to deal with the supposed doppler running around in his city and Geralt informed him there was no price because he refused to hunt and kill in a city due to possible innocent bystanders and that he didn't view dopplers as a threat. Chappelle appeared to be annoyed at this and threatened that he'd have to force the witcher to do it if Geralt and his friends wanted to leave the city, before walking off with his armed men. From this conversation though, the doppler learned what he needed: that Geralt wasn't there to hunt him down.Later that day, Geralt caught up to Dudu and was on the verge of letting him walk off when Dudu, having taken on Dandelion's appearance, was unexpectedly knocked out by one of Dandelion's angry exes and began to change to his natural form. Geralt quickly covered him up when the group was approached by Chappelle once more. Afraid for Dudu's life, they tried to say he was just sick but Chappelle approached the rolled up material that the doppler was in and proceeded to address Dudu by his name and told him to change back to Dainty's form, the idea being ""all halflings look alike"" to everyone. After agreeing to pass off Dudu as Dainty's cousin, the doppler that was Chappelle informed them what happened to the real Chappelle and he'd just been fortunate enough to be nearby. As he, like many other dopplers, just wanted to live in the cities without fear, he took over Chappelle's form to try and make things better. Satisfied with this, the group kept his secret safe.However, in 1272, Caleb Menge (the Temple Guard's commander and the Witch hunter's leader), figured out that the real Chappelle had been replaced with a doppler and summarily captured and burned him at the stake with the sorceress, Felicia Cori."

"429","Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon Older Ciri Child Ciri","Human","Female",NA,NA,"Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253,[4] and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday.[5] She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias ""Duny"" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and Geralt proclaimed the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to Duny.Ciri was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year[6] and initially, Calanthe ordered her advisor Mousesack to kill Geralt,[7] wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise. Mousesack was ready to go, as nobody simply refused the queen, but when he was summoned a short time later Calanthe retracted the order without explanation.[8]Growing up, not much is known about Ciri's relationship with her parents, thought it appeared Pavetta adored her daughter, with others remarking how it was rare for her to be parted from Ciri. However, this didn't stop Pavetta from secretly sending Ciri ashore just as the small family was set to sail out from Skellige to Cintra, against Calanthe's wishes, who wished for them all to stay. Shortly after, Pavetta and Duny died at sea around the Sedna Abyss, making Ciri an orphan before she was 5 years old. Angry at her nephew-in-law, Crach an Craite, for letting them sail out, Calanthe then had Crach swear a blood oath that he'd always protect Ciri before deciding to forbid Ciri from visiting the isles again. However, this ban only lasted 6 months before Calanthe let Ciri visit Skellige once more every summer and winter.[9]With the death of her mother, Ciri was now the only remaining heir to Cintra and thus Calanthe took special care to raise her granddaughter. Despite Calanthe's attempts to keep Ciri shielded from learning about being a Child of Surprise and that she was destined to be a witcher since birth, Ciri's nanny told the young girl all about a white-haired witcher, and that he'd one day come for her to be taken away to be trained as one as well. When Calanthe found out she was furious but by then the seeds had been sown and Ciri began to firmly believe that was her destiny.[8]Then, 6 years almost to the day when Duny's curse was lifted, Geralt returned to Cintra but Calanthe, not wishing to lose her only remaining descendant, hid Ciri amongst a group of boys and had them playing around in the moat outside the castle when Geralt dropped in, who erroneously believed Pavetta had a son and wondered which one ""he"" was in the group. Despite this, he refused to take any child with him and left without even learning the true identity of Pavetta's child.Shortly after, Calanthe arranged an engagement between Ciri and Windhalm of Attre, a now 20 year old who once vied for Pavetta's hand 7 years prior. However, Calanthe had a change in heart and called off the engagement years later[6] before setting up another one, this time to Kistrin, the sole prince of Verden. However, the now 10 year old Ciri wasn't fond of this idea or of Kistrin and, no sooner had she arrived in Verden in 1263 to meet her suitor and his family, did she escape with aid from some of the soldiers. This plan went awry though as the party got lost and ended up in the dreaded Brokilon region, a forest off-limits to anyone not friends with the dryads that lived there. While normally the dryads shot to kill on sight, Ciri wasn't noticed by them, though the rest of her party wasn't so lucky and were killed as they mistakenly crossed the border.While she wandered alone deeper into the dangerous forest, she was spotted by a giant centipede and almost met her death there when her screams were heard by Geralt and Braenn as they were incidentally nearby. After they killed the giant centipede though, Ciri tried to take off but immediately stopped when Braenn nearly hit her with an arrow. Despite this, the young princess refused to answer them and went as far as stating she'd have both of them beheaded before eventually joining them in their trek to Duén Canell, all the while telling Geralt how she didn't want a husband and threatening to bite Geralt to get him to answer her questions before the witcher threatened to whip her with his belt, making her behave politely the rest of the trip.When the group arrived in Duén Canell, Ciri met the injured Freixenet, who also wished to beat the young princess for running away, before the governor revealed that Geralt was a witcher. Before Ciri could ask further on this, Braenn started to lead the princess away and Ciri realized they were preparing to make her a dryad and began to cry, though allowed herself to be led away.A few hours later, Ciri sat with the dryad queen, Eithné, in her home. As Geralt arrived to discuss his reason for being sent to Brokilon, it eventually turned to Ciri, who was to be made a dryad. However, Ciri had already told Eithné something she hadn't revealed to Geralt yet: that she was destined to be a witcher and on learning who Geralt was, she realized she was destined to him. As Geralt made to leave rather than watch the young girl drink the Water of Brokilon that'd erase all her previous memories, Ciri begged him to stay and so he did for her sake. As he watched though, Ciri didn't show any of the normal signs after drinking the water and when the dryad queen asked the young girl who she wanted to go with, she revealed she still wished to go with Geralt, and thus the queen allowed the two to leave.Geralt, now realizing Ciri was his Child of Surprise, traveled with her out of the forest, though when he took off east to Brugge Ciri appeared uncomfortable, remarking she felt they were going the wrong way, but followed anyways. A short time later it appeared she was correct: they ran into a group of King Ervyll's soldiers who were staging a merchant robbery as an act by the dryads. Not aware of the situation, Ciri suddenly remarked the dryads couldn't have done it as the tree was cut down, causing the men to try and kill her and Geralt, but Geralt held them off as he demanded she run. Instead of running far though, Ciri instead took an earlier story Geralt told to heart and climbed all the way up a tree. After the mercenaries were killed off by Geralt, nearby dryads, and the arrival of Mousesack, Ciri rejoined them, though the druid remarked Calanthe would probably be ready to spank the girl despite being sent by Calanthe to call off Ciri and Kistrin's engagement.That night though, Geralt tried to take off once more without Ciri, who awoke after he rode off and yelled after him not to go and that she was his destiny. However, Geralt didn't turn around, leaving Mousesack to take her back to Cintra.[8]Shortly after Ciri traveled back to Skellige and at one point became extremely infatuated with one of the kingdom's famous warriors, Olaf Stigvason. However, this love was never meant to be as he was 35 years old, married, and with children older then Ciri. Distraught at this, Ciri decided she'd commit suicide by drowning and waited for favorable weather conditions to do so. This took too long though and during the wait, she was able to overcome her infatuation with the warrior.[6]Sometime later that season, she saw some of the boys, including a 15 year old Hjalmar an Craite, playing a game on the ice where they'd try to see how many rocks in a row they could jump over while skating. Hjalmar held the current record until Ciri, extremely agile and fast, beat it. Not to be outdone, Hjalmar tried to beat Ciri's record but smashed into the ice instead, breaking several bones in the process. Despite this, Hjalmar held no grudges against Ciri and the young girl regularly visited him while he healed. Being young and naïve, the two soon got ""engaged"" but as soon as Crach heard of this he promptly broke them up as Calanthe had other plans in the works to marry Ciri off and the young girl was dragged back home to Cintra by her grandmother.[9]Shortly after, Calanthe arranged Ciri's third official engagement: this time to the 9 year old Radovid V of Redania. Before the children ever had a chance to meet though, Radovid's father, Vizimir II, called off the engagement 6 months later.[6]In 1263, the Nilfgaardian Empire, which had been taking over kingdoms in the south for some time, eventually decided to move on Cintra. During the final push, Ciri found herself barricaded in the capital's castle with her grandmother and many of the nobles, with no chance of surviving as it was only a matter of time when the Nilfgaardian soldiers would break in. Unknown to her and her grandmother, there was also a Nilfgaardian spy in the castle and so when Calanthe had some of her soldiers try to flee with the young Ciri, the spy signaled to the invaders that she was escaping.[9]Ciri's escorts ran into Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach's group and a chase through the burning city unfolded before Cahir's men eventually caught up with the Cintran guards and a fight ensued. As both Nilfgaardians and Cintrans alike died, a frightened Ciri was dropped to the ground and barely escaped from being stabbed herself. Still in a daze, Ciri soon found herself alone with Cahir, the only other survivor out of the fight and distinguished by his winged helmet. As he picked up Ciri, she began to scream before fainting. A short time later she came to as Cahir had managed to escape the city with her, but with Cahir not knowing her language, nothing helped ease her mind. Later that night, when the two went to sleep, she managed to slip away from him.Now alone, Ciri ended up wandering the forests for two weeks before finding a group of fugitives and staying with them for a month[10] before she was eventually taken in by druids, as they tended to take in homeless children as a result of the war.[8] A short time later, Goldencheeks took her in and so Ciri moved in with the woman and her family in Lower Sodden. While Ciri didn't reveal who she was and where she was from, Goldencheeks took a liking to the girl over the next six months,[10] especially as she herself couldn't bear anymore children and only had sons. As fate would have it though, Goldencheeks' husband, Yurga, was out on a trip during this time and was rescued by Geralt, who didn't know what else to ask for as a reward and so enacted the Law of Surprise. When Yurga brought the witcher back to his place in 1264 and learned of the unexpected girl his wife had taken in, Ciri suddenly spotted Geralt and cried out to him before the two ran to each other, reuniting once more.[8]With Geralt now accepting Ciri as his destiny, he took the young girl with him to Kaer Morhen, both to keep her in hiding and to train her to be a witcher. During the trip there Ciri was often plagued by nightmares of the knight with the winged helmet and Geralt had to reassure her everything was ok while holding her close until she fell asleep. When they finally arrived that autumn, the princess was initially afraid of the witchers but as soon as Geralt confirmed she was their destiny she began to see the small group as family and friends. That same night that they arrived though, the witchers quickly learned Ciri was no ordinary child. Thirsty, Ciri grabbed the nearest drink off the table, and before the witchers could stop her, she accidentally drank White Seagull which, combined with her Elder Blood, sent Ciri into a trance, speaking in another voice but incoherently.[10]A bit uneasy by this but not able to do anything else, the witchers, including Geralt, Vesemir, Lambert, Eskel, and Coën, began to train Ciri as a witcher. However, during one training episode she fell and once more went into an incomprehensible trance. It was only the third one, during one of her many nightmares, that she began to speak coherently, prophesying Coën's and Geralt's deaths. However like all the previous ones, Ciri never remembered them nor what she said so the witchers never told her about the episodes.Regardless, the witchers needed help understanding what was happening to Ciri and so in 1265 they sent for the sorceress Triss Merigold, as Geralt didn't wish to involve Yennefer due to how they last split up. By December, Triss arrived in time to see a now 12 year old Ciri running the Trail, an obstacle course around the keep, but as Ciri made to jump the Gullet portion, she landed wrong and Triss ran over. While initially scared of the unknown woman, Ciri eventually let the sorceress heal her wound before the two made their way to the keep. As they did so, Triss witnessed firsthand one of Ciri's trances, this time predicting Triss' death, before Ciri woke up, believing she'd fallen asleep.The next day, Triss went with Ciri to her room to inspect the young girl while fixing up her clothes, which had been haphazardly put together by Vesemir. As they talked, Ciri eventually confided she was scared of some of the training equipment before revealing something she'd been too embarrassed to bring up to the men: her menstruation had begun and, with no other women around, had no idea what was going on. With Triss' guidance, Ciri went and informed the witchers that she was ""indisposed"" and wouldn't be doing any physical training until it'd passed. Then, following Triss' earlier instructions, asked for Triss to be allowed to stay, before excusing herself. With that, Triss set forth a condition that the witchers stop feeding Ciri their special herbs and mushrooms as, while they helped with fitness and building muscle, they could have adverse effects on Ciri's womanly attributes as she grew up.On Midwinter night, as Coën kept Ciri distracted with a game, Triss revealed Ciri was a Source, leading to initial denial as the witchers pointed out Ciri couldn't even do basic signs. However, Triss revealed that Sources were only transmitters of magic and therefore had no actual control over it: if they tried to force it nothing came out, but a strong emotion could unexpectedly flatten half a town. After the witchers revealed to Triss Ciri's past trances, Coën came through with Ciri and Triss gave the young girl White Seagull to send her into a trance once more, with the aim to find out what was speaking through her. Triss soon learned though that whatever was speaking through Ciri was extremely powerful, too powerful for Triss to control and stop it if it ever burst through Ciri. Naturally, Ciri didn't remember any of it and, despite not knowing enough Elder Speech to make sentences, as she was coming out of the trance she spoke in the tongue to say ""something is ending."" Knowing they needed help from a more experienced mage, Geralt finally relented in asking for Yennefer's help come spring, as they planned to take Ciri to Ellander's Temple of Melitele for schooling.As the winter went on, Ciri continued her witcher training while also taking Elder Speech lessons from Triss, the latter of whom kept an eye on the girl every day and night to make sure whatever spoke through Ciri didn't come back, while also soothing her back to sleep when she woke up from nightmares. At one point the witchers even made a custom sword for Ciri to match her build.One night in the middle of February 1266 though, Ciri slipped down and eavesdropped on a conversation Triss was having with the witchers in regards to their indifference to politics and went into detail about what happened during the Battle of Sodden Hill. As Ciri ran in, proclaiming she'd stand by Triss in fighting the Nilfgaardians as they'd killed her grandmother, Ciri revealed she thought she was training to kill, as she wanted to kill the winged helmet knight that haunted her dreams. Geralt sharply chastised her, informing her they were training her to save lives, not to kill out of fear and hatred, before sending her out of the room.Distraught, Ciri ran out into the courtyard and stopped on the ledge of one of the walls where she inspected her sword. As Geralt and Triss approached, she cried out that nobody was going to take her sword from her, but as she moved, she lost her footing and almost fell to her death but Geralt caught her in the nick of time. After speaking comforting words to Ciri, the three agreed it was time to head south to the temple in Ellander.As the trio made their way through Kaedwen to Ellander, Triss suddenly fell ill from food poisoning, preventing them from being able to ride for very long as they had to keep making stops for her. At one point they reached an outpost that was overflowing with merchants and soldiers and, despite Geralt sending Ciri to look after Triss, the girl showed back up in time to overhear one of the commandants vehemently proclaiming all nonhumans were in cahoots with the Scoia'tael and Nilfgaard had been backing them. Before more could be said, the trio were asked to leave as, despite Triss not being contagious, the soldiers didn't want to take a chance. One of the soldiers though pointed them in the direction of a convoy that was headed in the same general direction and who might be able to better assist Triss.Within a day, they'd caught up with the convoy who were made up of old dwarven acquaintances of Geralt's and were now following King Henselt's orders to deliver a special order. As they traveled with Yarpen Zigrin and his group, Ciri eavesdropped a few times on their conversations, particularly when Scoia'tael were mentioned, as Yarpen was adamantly against them, despite being nonhuman himself.At one point, when Geralt headed to the back of the convoy, Ciri sat up front with Yarpen and, after being shown how to steer the wagon, asked Yarpen about his earlier conversation with Geralt, namely what he meant by the witcher being indifferent before she figured out that Yarpen was between a rock and hard place: being nonhuman he wasn't accepted by humans but by helping a human king, he was a traitor in the Scoia'tael eyes.As the trip continued, she and Geralt both took care of the still ailing, but now recovering, Triss. However, Ciri became annoyed when the other dwarves wrongly assumed that Triss and Geralt were a couple, and was further annoyed with Triss when the sorceress appeared to try and snuggle up rather too much to Geralt when they helped bathe her. After being asked by Geralt to leave during one such episode, Ciri bumped into Yarpen and asked who was right in the fight between the Scoia'tael and humans. After a while, Yarpen finally noted that he'd like to live in a way where he didn't have to ask for forgiveness and everyone would learn to live next to each other. With that, Ciri remarked how Yarpen wasn't all that different from her.The next day, Geralt let Ciri ride a bit ahead of the convoy but, being anxious just to run off for a short while, she galloped way ahead of the convoy to take in the silence and surroundings and soon made her way a bit off the main road. As she enjoyed the forest area she began to think how she'd never be indifferent, that she intended to save defenseless people from evil, like the horrors she saw during the war, and couldn't understand why Geralt and the other witchers were neutral about it.While thinking this over she suddenly ducked down beneath a bush and none too soon as, across the clearing, a large band of Scoia'tael appeared and began to move through the area. When they were finally gone and she felt safe, Ciri popped back up only for Geralt to grab her to keep her from screaming in surprise. As Geralt instructed her back to the horses, he told her not to say a word of what she saw to the others and and that the trio would depart from the convoy tomorrow. Infuriated and not understanding his indifference in this, Ciri questioned Geralt about it, who calmly told her the Scoia'tael group wasn't there for the convoy, but something else. He then led her to Shaerrawedd, an ancient elven palace now in ruins. However, in the center of the ruins still remained a statue of Aelirenn, an elf that'd tried to lead one last desperate battle against humans 200 years ago. While the elders didn't wish to, feeling they could wait out humanity with their long lifespans, Aelirenn was able to rally most of the younger elves, and the only ones able to still have offspring. The fight ended in a massacre and thus doomed the elven race to annihilation.Finally understanding that witcher neutrality wasn't about being insensitive but rather to prevent more unnecessary massacres, Ciri then asked to take one of the special roses to remember. As she did though, she pricked herself and suddenly realized the rest of the convoy was under attack and the two galloped back to get to Triss.As the two arrived, the convoy was indeed under attack by Scoia'tael and, ignoring Geralt's orders to head into the woods, Ciri hurried to Triss and pulled her into cover while the fighting continued all around them. While initially protected by the others around her, soon Ciri found herself alone, face to face with an elf, and now without her sword. As the elf moved in though, she spotted Shaerrawedd's rose on Ciri, causing enough hesitation for Geralt to come from behind and kill the elf before Ciri passed out. When she came to, the group had been rescued by Dun Banner, another Kaedwenian military unit, but soon learned the whole convoy had been a trap: wanting to test Yarpen's loyalty, they were actually given common stone to transport while another tipped off the Scoia'tael about the ""special"" convoy so they'd attack it. As Geralt and Ciri looked on at the fallen acquaintances and Scoia'tael members, Geralt threw the now blood stained rose onto the elf he'd killed earlier to protect Ciri, with Ciri saying goodbye as Geralt asked for forgiveness.After the chaos with the convoy, the three had a far more peaceful trip to the Temple of Melitele and once there, Geralt left Ciri in Nenneke's care while he wrote to Yennefer about the situation and asking for her help in teaching Ciri.While Yennefer made her way to the temple, Ciri was treated like any other pupil, sleeping in a dormitory with the rest while learning and doing chores. When she could, she'd also write to Geralt to tell him about the goings-on.[10]As news of the possible war began to spread, Ciri and Yennefer left Ellander for Gors Velen and ultimately Thanedd Island and Aretuza where the sorceress intended to enroll the girl as well as attend a conference of mages on late June 1267.Things did not work out as planned though. There was a coup during the conference and several individuals including Vilgefortz and Cahir tried to capture Ciri once again, and once again failed with the girl escaping through an unstable magical portal in Tor Lara. Because of the portal's nature, Ciri was simply ejected in mid-air over the Korath desert.Unaware of where she was and without obvious recourse, the girl decided to make her way out of the wasteland by heading west. Unfortunately she wandered around in circles for some time before deciding to use the stars as a guide. She nearly died of exhaustion, dehydration and starvation. Luckily for her she met a unicorn whom she nicknamed Little Horse that helped her out of the desert. She used Fire magic to heal her companion, and while other unicorns, quietly observing her actions, were unpleased with utilising its power, they decided not to kill ther because of saving one of their own. Ciri went unconsious due to pyromantic visions.Next day, Sweers and his Trappers find her and (after a short conflict with one of Sweers' sworn enemies) brought her to safety in Glyswen. Ciri, who was still undergoing an emotional tribulation, then helped the Rats, a group of ne'er-do-wells, to rescue their member Kayleigh. She named herself Falka after the woman she saw in pyromantic vision. In the night Kayleigh wanted to ""thank"" Ciri by trying to force her to have sex with him, but was stopped by Mistle who wanted Ciri for her own. Despite sexual assaults Ciri stayed with the rats and even developed a romantic relationship with Mistle even while sometimes claiming she did no longer like what Mistle had done to her.[11]During their travels, the Rats attacked a convoy of Baron of Casadei's daughter. The baron hired a bounty hunter Leo Bonhart to capture her alive; however, Bonhart was already hired by Stefan Skellen who wanted her to be killed[12] so that the monarchy could be overthrown.[2]Bonhart killed the Rats and cut off their heads after their deaths. The hunter neither killed Ciri, nor brought her to Baron Casadei, therefore not fullfilling both contracts. Instead he imprisoned her for some time, beating her, mistreating and forcing her to kill in the arena at Claremont, which belonged to his cousin Houvenaghel.On Velen Ciri managed to escape with the help of Vattier's spy Neratin Ceka when Bonhart had taken her to the village of Unicorn on the eve of the equinox. He had gone here to meet with Skellen and Rience and possibly negotiate some terms to release Ciri. Bonhart then killed Neratin, and Skellen seriously wounded Ciri, disfiguring her with an orion as she fled the village on her mare, Kelpie.Later, she was found, near death by Vysogota of Corvo, who hid and healed her at his hermitage in the Pereplut swamp. She stayed with Vysogota until shortly after Saovine when she set off to find the Swallow's Tower, believed to be a twin tower to Tor Lara, so that she could return to Thanedd. Together with Skellen and Rience, Bonhart tried to hunt her down on the order of Vilgefortz, but she managed to escape due to the intervention of the Wild Hunt which scared off Bonhart's horse. Ciri entered the tower and was teleported to the world of the Aen Elle elves.[9]There she was greeted by Avallac'h, an Aen Saevherne. He explained to her that she had to 'pay the debt' referring to the perceived loss to the Aen Elle when Lara Dorren took Cregennan of Lod as her lover. The elves believed that the latter had 'stolen' Elder Blood from them by marrying Lara. To atone for that 'crime' Avallac'h wanted Ciri to beget a child with Auberon Muircetach, the king of the Aen Elle. That being the only way Avallac'h would let her return to her own world. On their way to Tir ná Lia, the Aen Elle capital, they met Eredin and his Dearg Ruadhri. Ciri was initially quite infatuated with him - he realised that and tried to use it to control her. They also came across a pack of unicorns which appeared to be at cold war with Aen Elle.In Tir ná Lia Ciri finally met Auberon, who many times tries to conceive a child with her, however he could not - to him she was just a human, a being of no interest for an Aen Elle. Nevertheless, he was very proud and refused to admit it. Eredin suggested using a 'potion' which would improve Auberon's performance and allow him to conceive a child with Cirilla. He also told her the truth (probably to gain her trust) - that Avallac'h would never let her go. Knowing this, Ciri found help with the unicorns where she also met Little Horse/Ihuarraquax, by then fully grown. The unicorns explained that both Fox and Sparrowhawk had once possessed The Gate of the Worlds, a mystical power known only to those of the Elder Blood but they had lost it. Now they wanted these powers back and for that they needed Ciri. This could not be allowed, however, and the unicorns explained to Cirilla how she should escape.That same day Ciri once again visited Auberon only to find that he had drunk the 'potion' given to him by Eredin. Unknown to Sparrowhawk it happened to be too strong and killed Auberon. That night Ciri attempted to escape Tir ná Lia and its barrier by using a boat and swimming with the river's current. She was stopped by Eredin who then revealed his true intentions, being the same as Avallac'h's. The two battled and Ciri proved victorious due to the elf's underestimation of her abilities - she wounded him and threw him into the river. Later on she mounted Kelpie and rode away from Tir ná Lia. She met Horsey, who was in fact named Ihuarraquax and offered his help (actually his being by Ciri's side was a part of her bargain with the other unicorns). They came across a huge pile of bones.To her horror, Ciri realized that the skulls had human teeth making them a pile of human bones. Ihuarraquax explained that it had been a human world until the elves led by Fox and Sparrowhawk arrived and killed them all - this also would be the fate of other worlds, including Ciri's own, should Avallac'h and Eredin succeed in once again harnessing the power of time and space. Nevertheless, Ihuarraquax and Ciri realized that they were being chased.Little Horse urged Ciri to jump to another world - the only way to escape. She, however, didn't know how. The unicorn became her guide and they jumped. This led to the manifestation of Ciri's strongest power, giving her the title of The Lady of the Worlds. That power allowed her to traverse space and time at will. Not being able to control it, however, Ciri had to journey through many different worlds to finally find her own. She traveled to Stygga Castle to give herself to Vilgefortz in exchange for Yennefer's freedom. However, when she arrives there, he refuses to release Yennefer and instead reveals his plan to impregnate her and use her placenta to gain access to the Elder Blood. She was saved by Geralt and his hansa and later the Impera Brigade under the command of Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself; during the ensuing battle, Ciri encountered and battled Leo Bonhart, using her training from Kaer Morhen to outmaneuvre, then seriously injure the bounty hunter. Bonhart seemingly succeeded in convincing Ciri to spare his life, insisting she was too noble to kill a beaten, unarmed man but Ciri ultimately killed Bonhart in self-defence when he made a last attempt to attack her from behind. While Emhyr revealed to Geralt that he too had intended to impregnate Ciri, after sending Geralt and Yennefer away, he instead informed Ciri that he is her father and leaves Stygga Castle.Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri then set out from Stygga Castle and travel; first, they visit Jealousy, where she visits the graves of the Rats. Yennefer then left for Vengerberg, and Geralt and Ciri traveled to Toussaint. As they arrived, they found Dandelion, about to be executed for angering Anna Henrietta by falling in love with another woman. He was pardoned, and Geralt advised that they leave before she could change her mind and decide to order his execution again. Ciri was then summoned to Vengerberg by Yennefer, and Geralt told her to meet him in Rivia in six days' time.After traveling to Vengerberg, she and Yennefer were invited to the Lodge of Sorceresses in Montecalvo, where they revealed their plans to send Ciri to Kovir under a false name to have a child with Tankred Thyssen, the only son of Esterad Thyssen. She expressed that she wished to think it over during her travel to Rivia as she had already agreed to meet Geralt there. Philippa Eilhart proclaimed that her ability to leave Montecalvo and travel to Rivia is dependent on what the Lodge decides, so she put it to a vote; Sheala de Tancarville, Sabrina Glevissig, Keira Metz and Assire var Anahid voted against her leaving Montecalvo, while Triss, Margarita Laux-Antille, Francesca Findabair, Ida Emean aep Sivney, Fringilla Vigo, and eventually even Philippa Eilhart herself voted in favor of letting her leave. She then traveled with Yennefer and Triss to Rivia.They arrive in Rivia in the midst of the Rivian Pogrom, and Ciri rushed into the crowd to try and find Geralt. After Yennefer and Triss released a hailstorm on the city and stopped the riot, they found Geralt impaled and bleeding out on the ground. After Ciri yelled at Yennefer because her magic was unable to save Geralt, the sorceress lost her consciousness. Ihuarraquax appeared on the lakeshore; his horn started emitting a light which was directed by Ciri on Geralt and Yennefer. The unicorn pointed to a boat; she put an unconscious Geralt and Yennefer in the boat and got in it with them. Geralt came to on Malus Island, and Yennefer informed him that Ciri had left.After leaving Rivia with Geralt and Yennefer, she traveled to a different world where she met a knight by the name of Sir Galahad who invited her to King Arthur's court at Camelot. She agreed, and the two rode off together, heading to Camelot through the lands of Y Dynan Bach Têg.[2]Ciri appeared in Crookback Bog where she collapsed and was found by the Crones. The Crones intended to give her to the Wild Hunt however, as she possessed Elder blood, they couldn't decide whether to cut her up for her blood or not. Having overheard this, Ciri escaped and fled into the nearby forest, narrowly evading Imlerith. Traveling west into Velen, she encountered a young girl named Gretka who was lost and rescued her as well as a local man from a werewolf. She was then taken to Crow's Perch and taken in by Phillip Strenger (known as the Bloody Baron) who alongside his men she befriended. During a race with Philip, the two are attacked by a basilisk and Ciri was forced to use her powers to save him. However, Ciri realized that Wild Hunt would sense her powers so she left Crow's Perch and headed to Novigrad.Ciri tracked down Dandelion to enlist his help in repairing a phylactery to lift the curse on Avallac'h, though she excluded the identity of her friend. After evading a trap set by the Temple Guard, Dandelion suggested going to Cyprian ""Whoreson Junior"" Wiley, who agreed to fix the phylactery in exchange for stealing Sigi Reuven's treasure. Wiley later turned on them, capturing and torturing their friend Dudu. Ciri managed to rescue Dudu but her activities got the attention of the Temple Guard, who chased her towards Temple Isle. Just as a crossbowman took a shot at her, Ciri teleported herself to safety.Ciri teleported all the way to Skellige, landing on the shores of Hindarsfjall, where she fell unconscious, dropping into a lake. Avallac'h and a native Skelliger, Skjall, found the injured girl and took her to Skjall's home to recover. When she came to, Ciri accepted the invitation to heal at the local sauna. But soon as she prepared to depart, the Wild Hunt descended on the village, forcing Ciri to flee once more. She found her way to Avallac'h, who was waiting with a boat. But upon seeing Skjall being cut down by a Red Rider, she attempted to turn back to help him, but Avallac'h stunned her with a sleeping spell and took her on a ship.Before Eredin's curse fully triggered, Avallac'h managed to bring Ciri to the Isle of Mists and put Ciri in a death-like slumber to hide her from the Wild Hunt. Avallac'h then sailed back to Skellige but the curse took hold, rendering it impossible for him to tell anyone who he was or where he hid Ciri. While Ciri slept, seven dwarves found her in the cabin and hid there as well, though they believed she was dead.Later on, Ciri was finally found by Geralt and once she was awakened by the magical firefly the witcher was given by a cured Avallac'h, the two embraced and caught up on all that'd happened when Ciri tried to return home, including what'd she learned: the Aen Elle world was facing annihilation and so the King of the Wild Hunt was trying to catch Ciri to use her to open a powerful enough portal to allow an army through to conquer their world.As they prepare to leave, they discover the dwarves hadn't bothered to wait and took Geralt's boat to flee the Isle, before spotting the Wild Hunt's flagship, the Naglfar, in the distance, forcing Ciri to teleport them directly to Kaer Morhen.Upon arrival, Ciri happily reunited with Vesemir, Yennefer, and Triss. However, the time for celebration was cut short, as the Hunt would soon assault the aging keep. Despite wanting to fight in the upcoming battle, Ciri was ordered to remain inside the keep while everyone else defended her. However, Ciri defied this order when she saw Triss come under attack by Wild Hunt warriors and rushed to her aid. She later assisted Eskel against Caranthir, before the general heard a war horn signaling him to retreat.Ciri's crippling scream at Kaer Morhen.Back in control of herself, Ciri attended Vesemir's funeral pyre with the rest but started to regret returning to Kaer Morhen and, despite Geralt's attempts to calm her, she snatched Vesemir's medallion off the pyre and ran off. She returned a shor time later to find Geralt, Avallac'h, Yennefer, and Triss discussing reassembling the Lodge of Sorceresses to fight the Wild Hunt and became incensed that decisions were being made without her and left once more.Trying to use the small window they had to recover, Ciri continued to train with Avallac'h but was disheartened that she wasn't progressing well, especially with Vesemir's death fresh on her mind.Ciri later stirs Geralt early in the morning, revealing she had discovered Imlerith was attending a sabbath on Bald Mountain in Velen, as would the Crones, though she hadn't told Avallac'h of her plans. Geralt can suggest visiting her biological father, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, in Vizima first or go to Bald Mountain immediately.If Geralt and Ciri go to meet Emhyr, the latter addresses her by all her titles as nobles and soldiers kneel before her. He then presents the second half of Geralt's payment as thanks for finding his daughter. Whether Geralt accepts or not affects Ciri. Ciri then engages in a private conversation with Emhyr but later stormed out, angry at his attempts to buy her.A few weeks later, Geralt and Ciri arrive at Bald Mountain and are forced to contend with the local celebration, which ends in them being sent to a sylvan named Fugas for execution. After slaying the monster, Ciri plays a game of rock, paper, scissors, to decide who will face the Crones and who would slay Imlerith. Ciri lost the game and thus went to confront the Crones. She interrupts them while they were stirring a cauldron full of human remains, prompting them to transform from beautiful women into their true, hideous forms. Ciri managed to slay Brewess and Whispess but Weavess managed to escape with Vesemir's medallion.Their mission a success, the pair head for Novigrad, where Ciri had a multitude of personal matters to take care of. With Geralt, she revisits all the people she had encountered in the city. She was also present when Geralt and Avallac'h bring Ge'els from the world of the Aen Elle to show him proof that Eredin murdered the previous Aen Elle king, Auberon Muircetach, so he'd stop supporting the regicide. Ge'els attempt to sow animosity between Ciri and Avallac'h, but it fails. Corinne Tilly, a oneiromancer, shows everyone through dreams of Eredin's regicide.After Philippa Eilhart and Margarita Laux-Antille are gathered, they ask to meet with Ciri. If Geralt accompanies Ciri to the meeting, it undermines her confidence. The sorceresses extended an invitation for Ciri to join the Lodge as an equal partner.The party then travels to Skellige to find an elven artifact called the Sunstone to lure Eredin into a trap. Ciri then expresses her desire to investigate Avallac'h secret laboratory in the isles, suspecting the elf to be hiding something from her. She goes ahead with Yennefer to await Geralt's arrival. After penetrating the laboratory, they find a genealogical chart of Elder Blood descendants; Avallac'h was studying all paths of Lara Dorren, even those thought extinct. They soon encounter a she-elf, claiming to be Avallac'h's lover, who proceeds to insult Ciri, calling her a degenerate half-breed and that Avallac'h despises that he needs her. Her words anger Ciri so much that she wants to tear up the lab. Geralt can support her and aid in the ransacking, cheering her up, or calm her down and fasten Lara Dorren's necklace around her neck, depressing her.Once outside, Ciri asks to go to Hindarsfjall to see Skjall, only to be told of his death. If Geralt refuses, it depresses her. If he agrees to accompany her, they either meet up later or teleport there. Upon arrival, Ciri learns that Skjall was never buried, instead thrown on a corpse heap. After finding his corpse and giving it a proper burial, they are accosted by a band of villagers, who take issue with their defiance against their elders' writ, as Skjall was dishonored and his name stricken. Ciri threatens retaliation if Skjall's grave is disturbed and reveals Skjall's role in saving her from the Hunt, restoring his honor.The party then sail to Undvik to spring the trap, with the Nilfgaardian fleet preventing the Naglfar from fleeing by sea and the sorceresses blocking their attempts to teleport. As the battle started, though advised to remain on shore, Ciri realized that Geralt and his Nilfgaardian detachment were frozen and decided to go out and assist. Avallac'h advised her to find Caranthir and break the jewel on his staff to lift the spell. After fighting through Hunt warriors and hounds did Ciri engage Caranthir, eventually destroying his staff, though the effort seemingly knocked her unconscious. Caranthir then attempted to grab Ciri, only for her to teleport away.After Geralt mortally wounded Eredin, the elven king stated that Avallac'h had tricked them both, pitting them against each other while he made off with Ciri. When Geralt confronts Avallac'h as another Conjunction of the Spheres begins, but Avallac'h drops his sword proving that he did not betray them but was just following Ciri's wish to come here. Geralt then confronts Ciri who tells him that she has to go inside the portal to stop the White Frost. Depending on Geralt's interactions with her, Ciri may either survive or die stopping the White Frost.If Ciri survives and didn't meet with Emhyr or met with Emhyr but Nilfgaard lost the war, Geralt will tell the Emperor that she died saving the world, before later meeting with Ciri to give her her witcher's blade. If Ciri survives and had met with Emhyr and Nilfgaard won the war, when Geralt meets with her in White Orchard, she reveals that she has decided to take her place as Empress of Nilfgaard.For an expanded version, see Template:Ciri Family Tree Expanded."

However, when she went in and started to dream, Sarah, a godling that'd been secretly living in the house and only made it appear haunted to scare the banker away, put Corinne under a spell so the mage had nightmares instead.She was eventually released from the spell thanks to Geralt, who'd dropped in to ask her for her assistance in finding Ciri. Thankful, she agreed to help and to meet her at her room at The Golden Sturgeon.Once she'd recovered from her ordeal at the house, Corinne used her abilities and helped Geralt get one step closer to finding Ciri by placing him in a dream state.

"434","Crach an Craite","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Crach an Craite, also known as Sea Boar (Elder Speech: Tirth ys Muire) and the Wild Boar of the Sea, was a nephew of King Bran Tuirseach of Skellige and was mentored by Eist Tuirseach, his other uncle.In his early years he was a contender for the hand of Princess Pavetta of Cintra, however, it never came to anything. After King Bran passed the throne to Eist Tuirseach, Crach became Jarl of Skellige, the main commander of the military forces. He also had a brief affair with Yennefer and remained fond of her afterward, which he demonstrated by helping her in her search for Vilgefortz in 1267.He was known for sometimes showing his fiery temper as well as a healthy appetite. During his youth, he was described as a broad shouldered man with a mop of red hair. Later when he was a grown adult, his eyes were said to be hawk-like.Crach was born in early 13th century on Skellige to the clan of an Craite. His mother was from the clan of Tuirseach. Not much is known about his childhood, only that he was taken by Eist Tuirseach, his uncle, as his pupil, and young Crach learned many things from him. When he was a young man he met the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg and the duo had a short affair. Even though they separated Crach remained fond of the sorceress for the rest of his life. Some time after their split Crach met a woman that eventually became one of his wives. This woman gave him a son, his first born, Hjalmar. Crach, now a father and married man, lived happily in the typical Skellige style. A little over 2 years later, he was part of the Skellige envoy sent to the kingdom of Cintra where he was one of the contestants for the hand of Princess Pavetta.Queen Calanthe of Cintra invited many noble guests to the courtship of her daughter Pavetta, who just turned 15 and thus was ready for marriage. One of the main groups invited were those from Skellige. Above all, the queen wanted Pavetta to marry a Skelliger to ensure peace with the islanders. Among those sent from the islands were Crach an Craite, Eist Tuirseach, druid Mousesack and skald Draig Bon-Dhu. There were also other contestants, after all, the princess was a very beautiful young lady. Apart from the Skellige party, there were lords such as baron Eylembert of Tigg also known as Coodcoodak, prince Windhalm of Attre, and all three sons of Lord Strept. There was however another guest who did not appear to be interested in the hand of the princess. The honorable Lord Ravix of Fourhorn. Unknown to most of guests, Ravix was in fact just an alias of the witcher Geralt of Rivia who was personally invited by the queen and who sat next to her for the entire feast.The queen thanked all the guests and offered them an incredibly rich feast. Crach, as is common amongst his people, rebelled and drank like a true Skelliger. After some time, the princess appeared and joined the feast. She however, was not very happy and barely looked up. Thus the feast continued quite normally until a commotion occurred in the throne room, and an uninvited guest appeared. It was a knight in full plate armor who introduced himself as Urcheon of Erlenwald. He stood before the queen and told her about his past. He told her that 15 years ago, he saved King Roegner, husband of Calanthe, and invoked the Law of Surprise. That law granted him the child of the king - Princess Pavetta.To the great shock of all the guests, the queen admitted, that what the knight says is true yet she has no intentions to give him his daughter. Instead, she tricked him into removing his helmet. As he did, he revealed, that he was no man at all but rather some hedgehog-like creature, covered in spines with a muzzle full of fangs. Triumphant, the queen said that the Law of Surprise stands yet the princess has to agree to go with him. Calanthe was sure that seeing that he is a monster, Pavetta will reject him immediately. That however did not happened and to great surprise - and horror - Pavetta agreed to go with the monstrous knight. Calanthe collapsed to her chair, and the fight erupted. Cintrian knights as well as suitors attacked the Urcheon and pinned him to the ground. That was however a grave mistake. Pavetta, seeing Urcheon knocked to the ground, burst into an explosion of raw Power. That eruption was extremely dangerous and threatened everyone's life. The storm created by her was so strong, that nobody was able to move properly.The witcher Geralt, and druid Mousesack were eventually able to calm the princess and stop the eruption. When the situation calmed down, the princess explained, that she and the Urcheon, whose name is Duny, were secretly seeing each other for over a year and that they fell in love. Duny was in fact human but suffered a curse that turned him into a monster, though after midnight he recovered his human form. Calanthe had no choice but to agree with their union. This decision was very difficult because of her fear of Skellige. Eist however took this chance, and proposed to the queen. Surprised, the queen eventually agreed to marry him thus fulfilling her desire for a union between Cintra and Skellige. Duny thanked the witcher and promised him anything. As is common amongst witchers, he invoked the Law of Surprise because he did not wish anything from the young couple. To a great surprise, Pavetta admitted, she was with child, a child which now belongs to the witcher.[3]Crach returned from Cintra empty handed but his loss was not that great as he already had at least one wife and a son, Hjalmar, back home. He eventually ascended to the title of Jarl of the an Craite clan and the ruler of Kaer Trolde. When his uncle and mentor Eist married Queen Calanthe, he became her and Pavetta's relative and Ciri, Pavetta's daughter, spent her summers and winters visiting Skellige. However, after Pavetta and Duny died during their trip, Calanthe, angry at Crach and Eist for letting the young couple sail out, had Crach swear a blood oath (bloedgeas) that he would always guard Ciri and give any help needed when called upon in regards to her safety, before the queen banned Ciri from visiting the isles again. However, this ban only lasted 6 months and Ciri was once more spending her summers and winters on the islands. On one such occasion, Hjalmar, now 15 years old, was challenging anyone to beat him at an ice skating game where they tried to see how many rocks in a row one could jump over while ice skating. Ciri took him up on this and beat his record. When Hjalmar then tried to beat the new record, he instead broke several bones and was bedridden for a time to heal. During this, Ciri visited him and, in their naivete, got ""engaged"". Terrified at what Calanthe would do, as Crach knew the queen had plans in the works to marry the young princess off eventually to another kingdom's prince, he promptly broke the two up and Calanthe dragged Ciri back to Cintra immediately.During the Second Northern War, Crach helped Yennefer and provided her with sanctuary as she was looking for Ciri, who was kidnapped. Thanks to his help, the sorceress made a great discovery and found a portal leading from Skellige to Nilfgaard. Even though the sorceress was arrested and tortured afterwards, eventually she and Geralt succeeded and rescued Ciri in no small part thanks to Crach.[4]Crach continued his rule as a Jarl and watched as his children grew into strong adults worthy of the an Craite name.In 1272 King Bran Tuirseach died and Crach attended the funeral, setting the funeral pyre on fire before announcing they'd soon gather to select a new ruler at the feast in Kaer Trolde keep. Eventually, Geralt and Yennefer appeared to talk with Crach on matters concerning Ciri but he informed them they had to wait as they had to have those contending to be the next ruler come forth.In the main hall, Crach then announced that those wishing to nominate themselves to come forward, dropping a weapon on a table in the middle of the hall as a sign of their commitment. As his son Hjalmar wasn't currently there but wished to be considered, Crach showed his son's axe before putting it on the table. When all the jarls' sons of the region finished nominating themselves, Crach's daughter, Cerys, came forth and proceeded to throw her weapon down as well much to everyone's surprise.Later, Crach had a discussion with the witcher and the sorceress, as the duo wanted to explore a local forest that suffered a magical explosion in hopes it would tell them something about Ciri. Crach granted them their wish before asking if Geralt could find the time to help his children in their endeavors. During this, he also voiced he didn't know what Cerys was doing, having nominated herself to be the next ruler, and while Skellige never had a female ruler before, he'd equally support his two children.Before he could attend the final feast though, Birna, who was one of the late king's wives and the mother of his firstborn son, met with Crach, getting into an argument over how the next ruler should be decided; in particular Birna wanted it to be hereditary starting with the last king, thus making her son, Svanrige Tuirseach, the next king, rather than a voting system between the jarls. As this was never Skellige's way, Crach firmly told her no and she left just as Geralt appeared once more. During their talk however, a pack of wild bears attacked the feast and while they were eventually killed, they murdered many guests including almost all the contestants except 3: Svanrige, Hjalmar, and Cerys. As the attack had happened in his own keep, the Jarls accused Crach and demanded an explanation. They gave a chance to his children to find evidence of who was responsible for the carnage, otherwise the an Craite clan would be held responsible for the slaughter.Not long after the coronation, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis decided to finally conquer the Islands and sent a massive fleet under his personal command. Nilfgaardians moved their fleet to the isle of Undvik. Before any battle could begin however, the final plan for defeating the Wild Hunt was commissioned. When the Hunt appeared on the Naglfar, Crach led his men against the wraiths and rammed their own ship into it, allowing them to board the Naglfar and fight against the Wild Hunt, with Crach facing none other than Eredin, the King of the Wild Hunt himself. Though he was no match for the Aen Elle elf, he fought him all the same and ultimately Crach was knocked down by Eredin, with the latter asking if he had any last words before he died. A true Skelliger at heart, Crach picked up his axe and futilely tried for one last attack, which Eredin easily evaded before killing Crach.[1]Crach is a leader in the Homecoming version."

Legend suggests the three are sisters and the daughters of the original ""Lady of the Wood"", also known as ""She-Who-Knows"". They are named Brewess, Weavess, and Whispess.Most of the time they communicate through an enchanted tapestry and a medium, an elderly woman named Gran who also seems to be their slave, or at least is bound to them in some way.The Crone is also the third aspect of the goddess Melitele.They found Ciri, who had been teleported into their bog, and took her to their cabin. They realized she possessed Elder Blood. The Crones argued whether to devour Ciri, but decided they would simply eat a limb before handing her over to the general of the Wild Hunt - Imlerith. Ciri overheard them and fled. Later, they charged Geralt with getting rid of an old enemy of theirs at the Whispering Hillock.The ealdorman of Downwarren, a servant of the Crones, cut off his ear and gave it to Geralt as the payment that the witches desired. This was common payment as tribute to the Crones, as they use the ears as a way to monitor the woods. When Geralt returned to the bog, he placed the ear upon the stone, the Crones came to him in person. Regardless of whether Geralt frees or kills the spirit, they tell him of their encounter with Ciri.Geralt can return with the Baron and his daughter to retrieve Anna, but if the Whispering Hillock was freed, the Crones punish Anna by turning her into a water hag because she allowed the children to escape. They send monsters, including a fiend to attack those trespassing on their land.Later, when Geralt and Ciri return to the bog to kill Imlerith, they split up and Ciri battles the Crones. She found that the three witches had taken on a more attractive form. The male volunteers found themselves victim to the Crones' deception and their remains can be seen boiled in a stew created by Brewess. The Crones are alerted to Ciri and transform into their original forms. Ciri managed to kill two of the Crones, the Brewess and the Whispess. The Weavess, however, managed to escape, snatching Vesemir's medallion from Ciri as she fled.If Ciri dies at the final battle, Geralt hunts down the Weavess, looking to retrieve the medallion she stole from Ciri. He finds her in the cabin in Crookback Bog where she summons monsters to fight with her. He kills her, and retrieves the medallion, but the monsters of the bog converge on him, despite the death of the final Crone."
"436","Cyprian Wiley","Human","Male","Crime boss"," Big Four Cutups Syndicate[1]","Cyprian Wiley, more well-known as ""Whoreson Junior"", was one of the four crime bosses of Novigrad in 1272 alongside Sigi Reuven, Carlo Varese, and Francis Bedlam. His gang used to control, together with the Blindeyes, The Bits district of the city, where they were in possession of an arena, a casino, a hideout in Novigrad, and a residence in Oxenfurt.Little is known about Cyprian Wiley's life before becoming part of the criminal underworld of Novigrad. He was the son of Alonso ""Whoreson"" Wiley who, just like him, was a feared and ruthless crime lord. As a young boy however, Cyprian was often beaten by his father,[1] which might have been the cause of his future cruel and merciless attitude.In the end, Wiley decided to put a stop to his father's reign by ordering his assassination. Soon after, now under the nickname of Whoreson Junior, he inherited all of his father's possessions like casinos, fighting rings, and brothels and became one of the most powerful crime lords in the city.[2]Sometime between 1267 and 1272, the most noted crime lords of Novigrad decided to set aside rivalries and forge an alliance of coin: thus Cyprian Wiley, Carlo Varese, Francis Bedlam, Gudrun Bjornsdottir, Sigi Reuven, and Hierarch Hemmelfart founded the Syndicate.Wiley and Hierarch Hemmelfart started a collaboration: the latter started selling zealots of the Eternal Fire to Wiley, who were later, without their knowledge, sent to his arena to be slaughtered in order to please the audience, as well as fattening the purses of both Wiley and the Hierarch.[1]Eventually, the four most influential gang bosses of the Syndicate became known as the Big Four, where Wiley still held a well-to-do position.In 1272, Whoreson Junior was contacted by Dandelion and Ciri, who needed his connections to find someone who could repair a phylactery. Junior accepted to help them, provided that they would bring him Count Reuven's treasure. However, Wiley began to suspect that Ciri and Dandelion were trying to cheat on him, so he kidnapped their friend Dudu in order to capture them when they would come to save him. In the end, Ciri managed to free Dudu and escape from Junior.[2]Not long after, Whoreson Junior was hired by King Radovid V of Redania, who tasked him with starting a gang war in the city, so that he could take control of Novigrad with ease.Following Radovid's orders, Whoreson sent his henchmen to the city bathhouse, where the other three members of the Big Four were having a meeting, having already noted Whoreson was acting outside the group's interests, in order to kill them. The attempt failed, however, and Carlo Varese started hunting Whoreson for vengeance, sending his men to raid Junior's hideouts.At the same time, Geralt of Rivia started looking for him too, hoping to find information about Ciri. In the end, King Radovid himself betrayed Junior as he no longer needed him, and revealed that Whoreson was hiding in a mansion in Oxenfurt.The witcher headed towards Oxenfurt and finally confronted Whoreson who, after a painful interrogation, revealed everything he knew about Ciri."

The Allgod, incensed by these meager offerings, threatened to curse them if they didn't offer better.If Geralt bargains with the Allgod: Thankful to the witcher, Dagmar and the rest continued to worship the Allgod, albeit with smaller offerings while the war continued.If Geralt doesn't bargain: Sadly accepting they had no other recourse, Dagmar proceeded to offer what little food he had left in storage.If Geralt kills the Allgod: Distraught, Dagmar and Preben proclaimed the Allgod said worse things would happen to them if he ever died and the two ran home to do a group prayer in hopes it'd save them.If Geralt reveals the cellar: Dagmar and Preben eyed the now exposed cellar with curiosity and some time later, the cellar was covered up with no worshipers showing up at the shrine."

"440","Julian Alfred Pankratz","Human","Male","Bard"," Geralt's company Redanian Secret Service University of Oxenfurt","Unnamed uncleJulian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as Dandelion (Polish: Jaskier), was a poet, minstrel, bard, and close friend of Geralt of Rivia.Not much is known about Dandelion's family except that he was of noble birth and was a cousin of Ferrant de Lettenhove, the royal instigator of Kerack.[3]He received his early education in a temple school, where, according to Geralt, literacy was ""beaten into him with a cane"". However, he didn't truly get into poetry until he was 19, after being inspired by his love for Countess de Stael.[4]Dandelion studied the seven liberal arts for four years at Oxenfurt University before later becoming a professor, but only taught students for a year before leaving the academy to travel the world. He would, however, visit Oxenfurt from time to time to give guest lectures.Within a very few years he gained worldwide fame and became known as one of the best minstrels in the Northern Kingdoms, with his best known song was the Ballad of the Lion Cub of Cintra.Dandelion first met Geralt at a fête in the town of Gulet in Aedirn. There, the poet had knocked up a girl under the musician's podium, and her four sturdy brothers were looking for him all over town, threatening to geld him and cover him in pitch and sawdust.The so called Valley of Flowers seemed just right the right location for the duo's swift escape, as it was supposed to be the edge of the inhabited world, the last outpost of civilization. It was in the small town of Upper Posada, located in a part of the Northern Realms that later became Dol Blathanna, that the pair had their first adventure together, involving a nasty Sylvan and an encounter with Dol Blathanna's native inhabitants, the Elves. During this adventure, Dandelion received his priceless lute from Toruviel.[5]Later, Dandelion was in Vizima and heard word of Geralt being injured and recovering at the Temple of Melitele in Ellander. He visited the temple and spoke to Nenneke, trying to win her favour, despite her annoyance of him flirting with one of the priestesses.After, he went and saw Geralt and the two spent time discussing Dandelion's education, as well as the lack of work for the witcher. Later that day, the two left for the city of Ellander. Once they arrived in the city, they were confronted by Dennis Cranmer, Arthur Tailles and Count Falwick, and Geralt was forced to duel Tailles. After the conflict the witcher and the bard returned to the temple and said their goodbyes before leaving.At some point Dandelion offered his services to the Redanian Secret Service, though it seemed his loyalty was dubious at the least, as he also collaborated with Temerian agents and special forces.During his travels with Geralt, Dandelion started to write his memoirs, entitled ""Half a Century of Poetry""; twice, in fact. His first attempt was lost in the bottom of the duchess of Toussaint's closet after the poet was banished from her duchy. But rather than bemoaning that loss, the poet decided to rewrite his memoirs from scratch. His poems were later bound in two collections: The Adversities of Loving and Time of the Moon.Dandelion was contacted by Ciri for aid in fixing a phylactery, which could either be used to cast or lift a curse; Ciri kept her objective to herself and Dandelion was unwilling to pry any further. Unfortunately, with mage hunts going on in Novigrad, Dandelion decided to turn to Whoreson Junior, a member of the Big Four crime lords of Novigrad. Junior agreed to find someone to repair the phylactery but for a steep price: he wanted Dandelion to steal Sigi Reuven's treasure and who was another Big Four.Dandelion eventually conjured up a plan with the help of Dudu and Kalkstein and while he succeeded in getting the treasure, the commander of the Temple Guard, Caleb Menge, found out and took the treasure for himself. Believing the bard had betrayed him, Whoreson Junior's men chased Dandelion and Ciri all the way to Temple Isle. Ciri manged to barely escape from being killed by teleporting away, but Dandelion was unfortunately captured by Menge's men and was jailed while Menge waited to publically execute the bard on Oxenfurt.In the game, Dandelion is an avid dice poker player, a sharper rank. From Chapter III onward, Geralt can play him for the sheer pleasure of the game and orens, but officially, it is only in Chapter IV that he can play the bard as part of the Sharper quest.Dandelion first appears in Flotsam as he's about to be hanged at the main square for debauchery and burning down one of Flotsam's buildings. Geralt, Triss, and Vernon Roche (for whom Dandelion has secretly been working as a spy) come across this scene and deal with the problem."

However, when a fellow swordsmith, Ernst van Hoorn, started their own business, van Hoorn realized they lacked real skill to compete with the others in the area and so began to find other ways to monopolize on the swordsmithing trade, pushing anyone out of business or making false accusations, like accusing Hattori of working with havekars.Hattori tried to fight back and took the matter to town hall, but with van Hoorn backed by a local gang leader, Cleaver, Hattori's appeal was denied.

Elsa suffered from rumors saying she was ""Nilfgaard's whore"", due to her taking down the Temerian lilies, as soldiers would burn the inn if they saw it. After saving her cousin Bram, the witchers Geralt of Rivia and Vesemir met Elsa at the tavern.Geralt asked whether Elsa had seen Yennefer, though she hadn't, so she recommended asking the other patrons.Later, when Geralt and Vesemir were preparing to leave White Orchard, Annie's sister began accosting Elsa for removing the Temerian lilies from the wall. The woman became violent and grabbed Elsa by the head and proceeded to bash it against the counter repeatedly. Geralt and Vesemir intervened and attracted the attention of some local men who believed that the witchers were conspiring with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. The men refused to back down, and thus the situation ended in a massacre. Both women became terrified of the witchers, and Elsa, cowering behind the counter, told them to leave and never return.Unable to continue living in White Orchard after the incident, Elsa traveled for a time and eventually ended up in Novigrad. Incidentally, while she visited The Kingfisher Inn one night and finished watching Priscilla's performance, she spotted Geralt in the crowd and accosted him in front of the crowd, noting he was the one who ""murdered those Temerian boys"" in White Orchard. However, the rest of the patrons paid no mind to this and became annoyed that she was ruining the atmosphere.After Novigrad, she settled down in a place called Rustone."
"466","Emhyr var Emreis","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Lord of Metinna, Ebbing and GemmeraSovereign of Nazair and VicovaroEmhyr var Emreis, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd (Nilfgaardian language: The White Flame Dancing on the Barrows of his Enemies), also known to a few under his alias as Duny, the Urcheon of Erlenwald (Polish: Jez z Erlenwaldu) was Emperor of the Nilfgaardian Empire, Lord of Metinna, Ebbing, Gemmera, and Sovereign of Nazair and Vicovaro from 1257 until his death sometime in the late 13th century. He also became the King of Cintra after marrying Cirilla in 1268.His rule of Nilfgaard was highly aggressive, often pursuing expansionist policies similar to those of his predecessors. This led to the outbreak of two wars against the Northern Kingdoms, both of which he lost. Emhyr var Emreis was an intelligent and brilliant ruler. He chose his people well and crushed many plots against him. He was ruthless toward traitors and moved towards his goals with great determination.He was publicly favorable to the Elder Races, in stark contrast to monarchs of the North.Transformed into a hedgehogIn his escape, Emhyr counted on a few loyal acquaintances for help while hiding at Ardal aep Dahy's place. He met with an astrologer Xarthisius who led him to the North, ""beyond the Marnadal Steps"", to look for a cure for his curse.[2]After some time, Emhyr finally arrived in the North and used the moniker ""Duny, Urcheon of Erlenwald"". In 1237, while prowling Cintra's forest region, he ran into a wounded and helpless King Roegner and after saving him invoked the Law of Surprise.15 years later, he presented himself before Calanthe during Pavetta's 15th birthday and the princess' would-be suitors in Cintra. Although Princess Pavetta was expected to be married off when she was 15, Duny had already started seeing her a year before and they secretly fell in love so when the queen hosted a feast for Pavetta's birthday, he took the opportunity and announced that from her birth, the princess had belonged to him, and that he had now come for her.Urcheon of ErlenwaldDuny then declared that Pavetta was to be his through the Law of Surprise he'd enacted when he rescued Calanthe's deceased husband, the former King Roegner. After a long and heated exchange, Duny was fooled by Calanthe into removing his helmet before midnight, exposing his monstrous form, yet Pavetta stated her approval of Duny nonetheless. This caused an uproar and the queen's vassals and the would-be suitors tried to attack Duny, with Geralt and Mousesack trying to protect Duny. However, one of the suitors managed to stab Duny and Pavetta's source abilities suddenly broke lose, sending furniture and people flying and threatening to collapse the castle itself.After Geralt and Mousesack silenced Pavetta, Duny, now presenting himself as Prince of Maecht and a son of Akerspaark, regained human form as it had struck midnight. After a discussion with Calanthe, who finally gave her approval for Duny and Pavetta to be married, Emhyr's curse was lifted. After thanking Geralt, he and his future wife were surprised with the news that Pavetta was pregnant, and Duny was soon to be a father.[3]When the child was born, they named her Cirilla.Around the time after Ciri's birth, the sorcerer Vilgefortz appeared before Duny at Cintra as an ally wanting to acquire wealth and power only the Nilfgaardian Imperator could provide. When Vilgefortz disclosed with him the prophecy, Duny decided to return to Nilfgaard to reclaim his heritage with Ciri in tow. However, under the watchful eye of Calanthe, Duny and Vilgefortz thought of a ploy to disappear without a trace by faking Pavetta's, Ciri's, and his own death on a sinking ship while Vilgefortz secretly prepared a way for them to survive. However Pavetta, aware of her husband's plans, smuggled Ciri out of the ship in time, leading to a scuffle between Pavetta and Duny as the former is pushed overboard and drowned at sea. Vilgefortz then teleported the ship from a raging maelstrom with Duny being the only survivor. Though distraught from inadvertently murdering his wife, despite not holding genuine feelings towards her, Emhyr was successful in faking his death as ""Duny"" and was able to return to his homeland and lead a revolt against the Usurper. One of the first things he did was that he rewarded Xarthisius with tower in the capital city for his aforementioned services.[2]Following all the power struggles around the throne, Emhyr had all of his dead political enemies disinterred and used their gravestones to pave his ballroom, earning him the nickname ""The White Flame Dancing on the Barrows of his Enemies"" or in Elder Speech, Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd.[4]Years later, as the Emperor of Nilfgaard, Emhyr commenced the First Nilfgaard-Nordling War with the aim of expanding his empire and began by defeating the Cintran Army at the Marnadal Stairs and holding a siege against Cintra, where his daughter was held. While Nilfgaard's forces invade Cintra, Ciri managed to escape and Emhyr soon sent his agents to locate and capture her.After several successful campaigns against the North, Emhyr's invasion was put to a halt after the utter defeat of his forces during the Second Battle of Sodden Hill, marking the end of the First Nilgaard-Nordling War. In response, Emhyr had the commanders that failed him on Sodden either executed or replaced by younger and more determined officials to lead his armies next time around while readying his forces for the next major war.[5]In his castle, Emhyr received a report from Field Marshall Menno Coehoorn that the rulers of the North - specifically Vizimir II of Redania, Foltest of Temeria, Demavend III of Aedirn, Henselt of Kaedwen and Meve of Lyria and Rivia - had a secret council at a castle in Hagge. Emhyr tasked the field marshall to disperse this information among the mages and members of the Chapter. Receiving no further news regarding Rience, Emhyr asked Coehoorn on his thoughts about Cintra. Coehoorn described it as 'gloomy' to which Emhyr followed by stating that it was different once and will be different again, promising Coehoorn a 'beautiful, happy' Cintra then cuts off by saying that he will leave governorship to someone else and wanted Coehoorn stationed at Dol Angra after he had quashed the rebellion within the province. At Dol Angra, Emhyr tasked Coehoorn to now allow himself and his fellow officers to be provoked by Meve or Demavend and will only allow themselves to be provoked immediately when ordered to do so.Coehoorn returned later to report to Emhyr the success of suppressing the rebellion within Cintra - despite a few escapees - and the capture of its leader, Duke Windhalm of Attre. Pleased by the news, Emhyr ordered Windhalm's public and 'spectacular' execution as an example to frighten others and demanded Coehoorn's presence there as Governor of Cintra and proxy for the emperor. Furthermore, Emhyr - impatient for Rience's report - tasked Coehoorn to have his mages set up a telecommunication link to Redania and eventually Rience, commanding him to immediately dispose of the witcher Geralt while leaving the sorceress Yennefer untouched. Afterward, a count by the name of Cahir, appeared before the emperor and the field marshall. Emhyr reminded the count of his blunder for capturing Ciri two years prior and the consequences he will face if he repeats it as he is provided with a chance for redemption. Commanding the attention of both officers, Emhyr tasked them with an important mission. They learn that the Emperor decided to arrange what would go down as a Thanedd coup which led to a new war with the Northern Realms, with the Nilfgaardian army led primarily by Menno Coehoorn.[6]He knew Ciri would be on the Thanedd Island and so he gave Cahir a second chance to capture her for him. Cahir, however, failed a second time and Ciri escaped through Benavent's portal on the highest floor of Tor Lara. Around this time, Emhyr learned that Vilgefortz betrayed him, when in fact he was never on his side and had been playing his own game. Thus, Emhyr ordered for Ciri, Vilgefortz and Cahir to be sought out by his Secret Service. Soon, a detachment led by half-elf Schirrú brought him Ciri, but when he saw her, he realized that he was given an imposter. Nevertheless, he pretended to believe it, while still having his secret police seek out Ciri with the ongoing war being in favor of the Empire. Also, as it turned out, a man he sent out to find Ciri, Stefan Skellen, was a conspirator who wanted to overthrow the Emperor and initiate a coup in Nilfgaard. At the time, Aedirn and Lyria and Rivia were already defeated, with only Kaedwen, Temeria, and Redania standing in the Empire's way.[7]After a short time, both Geralt and Emhyr found Vilgefortz and Ciri at Stygga Castle. Skellen, who worked with Vilgefortz, was captured by Impera Brigade officers who arrived at the castle together with their Emperor. At a meeting, Geralt alone had discovered that Emhyr and Duny are merely two names for the same person. Emhyr then told Geralt about his plans. Hearing about his incestuous plans with Ciri, just because of some prophecy, Geralt calls the emperor a monster and asks him not to delay his and Yennefer's death. By order of Emhyr, the witcher and the sorceress were given time to stay together, while he left the castle with Ciri. But, quite unexpectedly, on the road Emhyr realized the monstrousness of the plan and let his daughter leave, without revealing to her his true identity. Ciri managed to return to Geralt and Yennefer before they could proceed to kill themselves.Parallel to these events is the decisive battle of the Second War with Nilfgaard at Brenna, where the army of Nilfgaard loses to the combined forces of the North under the leadership of Constable Jan Natalis. But the war still ended successfully for the Empire: all the lands south of Yaruga, including Cintra, were left under the banner of the Golden Sun. To achieve this end, Emhyr married the false Ciri that Schirrú had brought him, who he grew to love. As a result, an agreement was signed in the capital of the conquered country, which became known as the Peace of Cintra.[2]In 1272, Emhyr and his troops crossed the Yaruga for the third time and, due to chaos caused by the Kingslayers, quickly conquered Temeria, Aedirn, Lyria and Rivia, as well as part of Kaedwen up to the source of Lixela. The remainder of his enemies, Redanians, Temerians, Aedirnians, Kaedwenis and others, gathered under leadership of King Radovid V of Redania, who managed to stop the Nilfgaardian Army on the Pontar river. Emperor Emhyr, certain of a quick and sure victory, started to call himself Ruler of the North and South. However, his war was not popular with Nilfgaard proper, leading to trade corporations and scheming nobles to begin plotting against him, which would force Emhyr to deliver a swift victory, lest his subjects rebel against him. He also decided to offer his daughter, Ciri, the throne as his successor. However, he required help finding her. Having previously captured Yennefer along with the witchers of the Viper School, he made her and Geralt an offer in exchange for them finding Ciri.After Geralt chased down leads in Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige, Emhyr sent his troops to retrieve him for a progress report. The witcher had brought with him Uma. Geralt explained to the emperor that he and Yennefer suspected that the creature may be a transformed Ciri or maybe the key to finding her. Emhyr turned to Yennefer, asking if she was able to lift the curse on Uma. She stated that she believed she could, and Geralt added a phrase in Elder Speech that Ciri told Dandelion, which would be key to accomplishing it.When Geralt chose to seek help against Eredin, he spoke with Emhyr, explaining that he had found Ciri's location but, as soon as he would get to her, the Wild Hunt would attack, so he created a plan to bring the battle to Kaer Morhen. Emhyr agreed to lend Geralt Nilfgaardian troops to help with the battle, but only if Morvran Voorhis would lead them. Unwilling to allow this, Geralt backed down, and the two parted ways. Later on, a second battle against the Wild Hunt ensued, taking place on the shores of Undvik. This time, Geralt was more or less forced to agree with Nilfgaardian support and was given an army under the leadership of Duke var Attre.[9]If Radovid or Dijkstra rule the North (canon): Emhyr is assassinated by internal conspirators for losing the war.If Radovid and Dijkstra are killed: Emhyr takes over the North and wipes out all those who opposed him.If he won the war and Ciri visited him and survived: Emhyr abdicates the throne to his daughter.In 1290, Emhyr granted a title of an imperial treasurer of the crown to his confidant, Peter Evertsen. In the final period of rule, he even further extended Peter's prerogatives by raising him to the rank of coadjutor of the Empire, which could suggest he was no longer able to be the sole ruler of the Empire. He eventually deceased no later than 1301.[7]There are also five leader cards with Emhyr's name as leader of Nilfgaardian Empire Gwent deck. Four of which are part of the base game and a fifth that appears with the Hearts of Stone expansion."
"467","Eredin Bréacc Glas","Elf (Aen Elle)","Male",NA," Wild Hunt","Pale blue (games)Eredin Bréacc Glas, also dubbed Sparrowhawk by the unicorns, was an Aen Elle elf and commander of an elven cavalry known as the Wild Hunt. As its leader, he was known to most as the King of the Wild Hunt. Eredin was a high ranking general in his world until he killed the king and became his successor.Despite being a notable strong soldier who was also skilled in magic, not much was known about his younger years.When King Auberon Muircetach, ruler of the Aen Elle elves, created the Red Riders, he appointed Eredin as their leader and general. Eredin, who at the time could access the Gate of the Worlds, allowing him to travel to different worlds at will, used the Gate and led the Red Riders in raiding many different worlds. Their main objective was to find and secure a sufficient number of humanoid - preferably human - slaves, that could serve the elves. Over time, this made Eredin and his men infamous and feared and they began to use magic to make themselves look even more menacing, like skeleton shaped armor and altering their voices.As time went on, they eventually rediscovered their original homeworld: the Aen Seidhe world where, prior to the Conjunction of the Spheres, all elves were from. However, it was now controlled by humans and since the Aen Elle had a deep hatred towards the race, the Aen Seidhe world became their primary target with Eredin often leading raids on the world and stealing a great number of young individuals. People from that world quickly started to fear the riders and they gave them a new name - the Wild Hunt. Because Eredin always led his men personally, he was present almost all the time and, as the lead rider, he caused the most fear in the common folk and soon they started to call him the King of the Wild Hunt.An unknown time later, the unicorns freed themselves from the grasp of the Aen Elle and took the Gate from them, meaning Eredin could no longer use it. This also caused all the elves to be stuck in their world with no access to more slaves and so they began to study the magic of traveling to different realms. However, they were only partially successful and created navigators - specialized mages trained to open portals to different worlds, but they could only transport a small group of riders. Due to this, the riders used spectral forms in place of physical and traveled in the skies as a cavalcade of specters.Around 1267 the Wild Hunt sensed a certain individual with very powerful Elder blood who turned out to be a little girl named Cirilla. As Elder blood was crucial for regaining access to the Gate of the Worlds, Eredin set his sights on capturing her as he wanted to resume his invasions of other realms. The Wild Hunt first tried to catch her near the city of Gors Velen but this failed and his continued search for her proved fruitless. However, thanks to his fellow elf Avallac'h, who lured Ciri to the Aen Elle world and took her to the palace in Tir ná Lia, Eredin was finally able to confront her and the two elves gave her an ultimatum: either she lay with the king and give him a child that would reintroduce the Elder blood to the elves - thus possibly giving them access to the Gate again - or she would never leave the palace. Ciri eventually agreed and tried to fulfill her end of the bargain but Auberon was very old and hated humans, considering them little more than animals. Because of this, he was unable to perform and produce a child with Ciri. Eredin, sensing an opportunity, gave an aphrodisiac to his king that was actually a poison, killing Auberon. This, in turn, made Eredin the successor to the crown.With the king dead, chaos spread in the palace and Ciri, with the help of the unicorns, managed to escape not only the palace but the Aen Elle world altogether. Eredin pursued her with the Wild Hunt but she managed to evade them and so he returned to the palace empty handed.Once he returned, he proclaimed himself the new king, having made sure nobody knew about his role in Auberon's death. Only Avallac'h suspected Eredin, but he had no proof so he left the palace and went searching for Ciri on his own.Meanwhile, Eredin consolidated his power and made a few changes. Because he had no interest in the governing aspects that come with being a king, he appointed Ge'els to serve as his viceroy and take care of the state while he was leading the Wild Hunt. He also chose two elves as his most trusted generals - Caranthir as a chief navigator and Imlerith as a commander of the riders.He also haunted Ciri as a wraith while she rested in a French tavern, telling her that he would wait for her on The Spiral - a place he said she would eventually enter after her long journey through space and time.The Aen Elle world soon faced a new and dangerous threat known as the White Frost - a deadly phenomenon that caused an eternal winter, killing off everything that once inhabited the world, and was supposed to be the eventual end of every known world. Eredin decided the only way to escape the apocalypse would be to move the Aen Elle to the world of the Aen Seidhe and conquer it. However, his navigators lacked the power to move thousands of Aen Elle elves. Knowing Ciri's power would be able to create a large enough portal for his people, even if it were to kill her in the process, thus Eredin began to hunt for Ciri once more.This time however he tried something new. He knew that Ciri had loved ones so his new approach was to capture them and hopefully lure her into a trap while she attempted to save them. Thus he and his raiders went to Malus Island where Ciri's adoptive parents - Geralt of Rivia and Yennefer of Vengerberg - lived. Though Geralt managed to cut down many of the attackers, Eredin was able to kidnap the sorceress and took off with her. Geralt pursued him and was joined at one point by several witchers from the School of the Viper and, together, they caught up with the Hunt near the Hanged Man's tree in Nilfgaard and began to fight the Hunt. While the witchers proved to be capable fighters, they were too outnumbered, so Geralt offered to take Yennefer's place and Eredin agreed, releasing Yennefer.For some time, the witcher rode with the Wild Hunt and Eredin was satisfied as Geralt was an excellent lure for Ciri. As expected, she soon found out and in 1270 she managed to save Geralt from Eredin's grasp while not getting caught herself. Despite this, Eredin continued to haunt Geralt using his spectral form and eventually the two had a confrontation (with Eredin still in his spectral form) before he re-focused his efforts on Ciri, who by that point was being helped by Avallac'h.Eredin and the Hunt pursued the duo for over a year until one day the pair teleported to Ard Skellig. Sensing the power that came from such a teleportation, Eredin ambushed them in the forest and managed to inflict an extremely powerful Aen Undod curse upon Avallac'h that would slowly transformer the sage into a diminutive creature that humans would later call Uma. However, Avallac'h was not one to go down easily and cast a powerful spell that wrought havoc in the Hunt's ranks, destroying much of the forest, allowing the duo to escape, albeit ending up in different regions. Ciri ended up in Velen where she lost conscious and the Crones found her. However, the Crones served Eredin and when he was informed they had Ciri, he sent Imlerith to retrieve her. However, Ciri had managed to wake up and learn what the Crones had planned and escaped once more.Sometime later she returned to Skellige, this time to the village of Hindarsfjall, but not even a day later the Hunt attacked again. One of the locals, Skjall, helped her escape to where Avallac'h was waiting for her with Eredin and the Hunt hot on their heels, but the two made out into the water, leaving their pursuers on shore.With Ciri's location now unknown, Eredin waited for another chance Ciri might use her ability, giving her location away once more. Eventually Geralt, who learned Avallac'h had hidden her on the Isle of Mists, recovered her and the Hunt appeared, forcing Ciri to use her teleportation to transport her and Geralt to Kaer Morhen.Now knowing the location of Ciri, the Wild Hunt attacked the witcher keep in full force and Imlerith and Caranthir personally took part in the fight, but Eredin watched rather than join in himself. However, the witchers were able to put up a tougher fight than expected and Eredin called his generals away before blasting through into the courtyard with a powerful frost spell, freezing everyone caught in the blast, including Geralt.Ciri and Vesemir, who'd been shielded by a wall, were the only ones not affected and while the old witcher tried his best to get Ciri to safety, he was caught by Imlerith who began to beat him up when Eredin stopped him, realizing they could use his life as blackmail to get Ciri to go with them. Despite Vesemir's protests to not do it, Ciri started to walk unarmed towards Eredin so Vesemir stabbed Imlerith who angrily snapped the witcher's neck. Seeing the death of her old mentor, Ciri's grief and rage, mixed with her Elder blood, caused a burst of raw magical power, threatening to kill not just the Wild Hunt and Eredin, but all the witchers in the area as well. Eredin, driven by the need to capture Ciri regardless, tried in vain to get to her, but Caranthir opened a portal and teleported himself and the king away, ending the battle.In the days following Eredin's humiliating retreat, the Aen Elle king received a few devastating blows to his power base, starting with Imlerith being slain by Geralt at the Sabbath before the White Wolf and Avallac'h traveled to Tir ná Lia to show Ge'els via onieromancy of Eredin's regicide, which prompted the viceroy to refuse reinforcements should Eredin call for aid.Eventually, Eredin responded to a call from Ciri using the Sunstone, prompting him to redirect the Naglfar to the coast of Undvik. He soon found that it was in fact a trap, as the Wild Hunt was beset by both Nilfgaardians and Skelligers. On the deck of his ship, Eredin faced Crach an Craite and the elf proceeded to toy with the jarl, dealing him grievous wounds before asking if he had any final words. Crach refused and went in for one last attack, which Eredin cut down with ease, killing the jarl.He was then confronted by Geralt and Eredin proclaimed he had something to tell the witcher but would only reveal it as the witcher was dying. As they battled, Eredin opened various portals into other realms where the two continued to fight before returning back to the Naglfar and where Geralt proceeded to stab Eredin in his left eye before dealing a fatal blow. Dying, Eredin confessed that Avallac'h had manipulated both of them into this confrontation so he could use Ciri for his own purposes before succumbing to his wounds.Eredin Bréacc Glas is one of playable characters in MOBA ""The Witcher Battle Arena"" added with Season 3 Update and has a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins. He is a warrior class hero.Eredin pursues Ciri across the main regions of third installment, aided by two of his generals: Imlerith and Caranthir.Eredin has led the Hunt's riders for dozens, possibly even hundreds, of years. In order to inspire greater terror, he wears armor making him look like a ghastly wraith. Elements of it are enameled in red and shaped so as to resemble a body whose skin has been flayed off. Crowning the armor is a skull-shaped helmet made of black steel, heavy, spiked brassards and greaves, and an openwork breastplate shaped to resemble skeletal ribs. Galloping on his mount, sword raised in the air, Eredin seems to most mortal men the incarnation of their worst possible nightmare.Very few are aware of the fact, but underneath the King of the Wild Hunt's ghastly armor lies a being made of flesh and blood. The Riders of the Wild Hunt are in truth not wraiths, but warriors of the Aen Elle, the Alder Folk, distant relatives of the Aen Seidhe, the elves inhabiting the world in which our tale takes place.Beneath he helmet of the King himself lies the face of Eredin, ruler and general of the Aen Elle. His face is slim and attractive, though clearly marked by cold cruelty. Dark, deep-set eyes, aristocratic features, a pale complexion, and thin lips twisted into a slight grimace complete our main antagonist's appearance. ...In the world of the Aen Elle, Eredin Bréacc Glas once led an elite cavalry unit known as Dearg Ruadhri, meaning the Red Riders in Elder Speech. It was this unit that constituted the initial core of the Wild Hunt, and eilt formation able to move between worlds. The initial number of Dearg Ruadhri is not known, yet one can confidently assume that it rose greatly after Eredin ascended the throne after the death of his predecessor, King Auberon. These skilled Aen Elle warriors are foes that Geralt will have to face many times in this installment of the series. There are also five leader cards with Eredin's name as leader of Monsters Gwent deck. Four of which are in base game, while fifth one comes with Hearts of Stone expansion."

Young Eskel feared for his friend's life when Geralt's hair turned white as a side effect of the Trial, though both managed to beat the odds and survive it together. They trained on The Trail. Leading around the Kaer Morhen through dangerous obstacles, it was generally known as ""The Killer"".[4]Eskel propped by Lambert, moments after receiving distorting scars.In the late 1210s, Eskel saved a prince of Caingorn in a dire struggle with a werebbubb gang and was offered anything he wanted as a reward. Given such a wide-open choice, he could not think of anything and instead recited the fabled Law of Surprise ""give me that which you find at home yet do not expect"" that he had heard Vesemir repeat over the years.This is how Princess Deidre Ademeyn born during an eclipse became his surprise child. Avoiding responsibility, Eskel took great pains to evade going back. Taking ridiculously long routes to avoid the proximity of Caingorn, he had heard about Deidre maturing into a highly unpredictable lass. Plus she discovered an innate gift of obstructing magic in her area, all superstitiously interpreted as ""accursed mutations of the Black Sun"". To determine what it all meant, Eskel carried a collective work about the phenomenon. He surmised the Council of Wizards meddled too much into state affairs, botched it and, had they not sent Sabrina Glevissig, Ademeyn might not have become ostracized.When she sought asylum around 1242,[N 2] Vesemir hosted her and Eskel busied himself with a kikimore hatchery in the old mine outside Kaer Morhen while devising a solution and where Geralt found him and the two discussed the situation. In a way, Eskel cared and didn't want to pass her to Glevissig who, bursting with unproven conclusions, wished to kill and study Ademeyn. After heading back, Vesemir called his pupils to present ideas. Eskel, unsure, asked Geralt for guidance.If the witchers chose not to help Deidre: The witchers decided not to help her, and Deidre went into a rage, almost fatally attacking Eskel before fleeing, with Sabrina stepping in to heal Eskel's wounds, though unable to remove his deep facial scars. She requested the witchers leave it for her to find and deal with Deidre. It is unknown if the witchers allowed this, but for the next two years, the notorious and murderous outlaw Deidre terrorized southern Kaedwen. Eventually she was hunted down and killed, either by Sabrina and her allies or a mysterious man with a terribly scarred face who refused to collect the bounty that had accumulated on her.If the witchers chose to help her: A scuffle between Ademeyn and her younger brother Merwin Ademeyn, Glevissig's misguided ally poised to rule, caught Eskel inside. Accidentally, the princess slashed the witcher across his face, but deeply regretting it, she subsequently left, resolving the entire matter. Several years later she sent him a letter with her royal seal upon it, but Eskel put it into a fire without reading it and never spoke of her again.Though the witchers of Kaer Morhen never spoke of her again, none of them forgot her either, each carrying her memory in their heart.[5]Early autumn 1264 had seen Eskel return again for the winter. A certain day, he went to close the main gate to stop heat from escaping when Geralt brought Ciri. Eskel embraced the Wolf and though he was skeptical at first, he nonetheless agreed with Ciri's training. He welcomed the girl at Kaer Morhen and took her luggage. Asked who else was inside besides Vesemir, Eskel responded with the names of Lambert and Coën, their mate[4] from the School of the Griffin.[6] Following months, Eskel helped Ciri train. He was worried, however, by her trances induced by an accidental sip of White Gull.[4]The third trance scared the witchers most, so they sat down. Eskel, who couldn't withstand the silence, swore and stood up to bring a bottle of something strong. Listening to Coën and Geralt, he took a vodka. Vesemir was furious about the booze in the beginning but later beckoned Eskel to pour him a pint. After more silence, Eskel came up with an idea to summon a witch. When Lambert mocked Ciri's latest prophecy by stating witchers are likely to die by monster teeth, he added dental gangrene may be another interpretation, seemingly serious. Vesemir hushed both, saying they shouldn't joke about it.[3]They decided to call Triss Merigold who arrived near Midinváerne of 1265. The sorceress noticed Eskel emanated potent magic when he bowed and politely took her hand to kiss it. Initially suspicious she could be poised to reveal witchers' secrets to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, Merigold convinced Eskel of having no such intention. He had a good relationship with Merigold altogether. When she had comments on how witchers treat Ciri, he listened. After determining what to do about Ciri, Merigold told the witchers about the situation in the Northern Kingdoms. Early on, Eskel asked several questions but ceased to as it turned into a dispute about neutrality.[4]Eskel wintering at the keep.Before 1267, Yennefer of Vengerberg visited Kaer Morhen and Eskel met her.[4] As the Second Northern War had neared its end, Eskel was in the vicinity of Brenna. After the massive battle of Brenna, he asked about Coën, who had fought for the North. Not only did he learn the jolly friend's fate, but Eskel retrieved a silver sword once held by Coën,[6] though not the one he had at Brenna.[7] The sword retrieved would then be displayed in the main hall of Kaer Morhen.[6]He never gained Geralt's renown, even though he equaled the White Wolf in experience and skill. Despite that, Eskel has made a name for himself as an efficient witcher, learned in his trade. One of his recognized heroics was when he saved a little girl from a basilisk, splitting it down the stomach and getting her out. He wasn't paid due to the fact he was wandering those lands hunting zeugl. He didn't avoid adventures either, as he had slept with a succubus and took fisstech with her.[1] During warmer times at Kaer Morhen, Eskel would go out to drive back harpies.[8]Eskel during the Salamandra heist.One day before Belleteyn of 1270, Eskel and Lambert were both at Kaer Morhen and were supposed to repair one staircase, which they postponed. A day later, Eskel and Vesemir were out hunting in the woods and found the unconscious Geralt, till then considered dead, not far from the keep. They loaded him on a cart and while his friend laid exhausted, Eskel explained how nobody knew where he disappeared following the Rivian Pogrom. Reassuring amnesiac Geralt that all would be well, they brought him to Lambert and Triss Merigold back at the keep.Shortly thereafter, Azar Javed and the mysterious Salamandra struck. Eskel, like all his comrades, defended the keep. Splitting, Vesemir assigned Eskel and Lambert to help him battle Savolla's frightener. Nevertheless, the thugs got the upper hand. Witchers retreated into the upper courtyard, where Merigold blamed Eskel and Lambert for not repairing that staircase as it could have helped the defense. When she also said Salamandra may be there for witcher mutagens, Lambert was skeptical but Eskel supported her. Though he helped slay the frightener, the bandits got away with the mutagens.After they burned the murdered trainee Leo on a funeral pyre, the witchers split up to seek information. Eskel took western direction as he had contacts there and preferred coast climate. Before leaving, Eskel gave Geralt valuable advice on fencing and alchemy.[7]Executing a forktail.Through the year that followed the defeat of the mastermind behind Salamandra, Jacques de Aldersberg, Eskel had several contracts. He pierced a fogler, fought a red-skinned insectoid or flamed four wraiths.[9] Next, he had been hired to deal with a hypnotic samovila but left after the peasant who paid fell in love with her.On a search for a katakan more than a century old and liable to kill drunkards, Eskel had to stalk the opponent for a month before dealing the final blow. Including trying to trap it a masquerade ball held by the nobles to attract the vampire, during which he took the time to enjoy the company of a number of the ladies there. He eventually managed to trick it into drinking blood from a woman he paid to be heavily intoxicated with substances that would weaken it. After that he managed to kill it with ease and took its carcass back to Kaer Morhen with him. Proper examination of the vampire's body parts, he believed, could lead to discovering a new witcher method of age determination based on footsteps.[1]Eskel was out pursuing a forktail in the fall of 1272 as the draconid needed to be removed and Yennefer lacked organs to distill ingredients required to disenchant Uma. After Geralt tracked Eskel down, Eskel agreed to let the White Wolf join the hunt and the two talked about recent events going on in their lives before tracking and following the forktail to its lair and finishing it off. Then Eskel mounted his horse and the two made their way back to the keep with a friendly horse race.Inside, Eskel showed Geralt the katakan specimen and began its autopsy. Later on, as Yennefer started the transformation process on Uma, Eskel was noticeably troubled by Uma being put through the Trial of the Grasses and eventually walked off from it. Though he did return and brought some rags to help clean the floor, and Yennefer after she prompted him, as Uma had vomited on her during the Trial. After Yennefer broke Uma's curse and went to rest, Eskel sat with Lambert to share anecdotes and drink when Geralt joined them.Eskel goes toe to toe with Caranthir.As Eredin Bréacc Glas realized Ciri was on Kaer Morhen, he attacked and Eskel partook in the ensuing battle. He defended the inner courtyard of the keep. After Caranthir opened a portal and brought a few riders of the Wild Hunt through, Eskel dueled Caranthir, holding his own expertly, until Caranthir utiilized his teleporting, which almost cost him his life. Luckily, this did not happen as fate smiled upon him—Ciri saved his hide. Caranthir retreated after being called away, but not before he ordered his troops to kill the two. Eskel and Ciri then killed the warriors and continued to fend off the Hunt.Suddenly, icy coldness tore through holes opened by the Wild Hunt, freezing Eskel in motion. He only unfroze after Eredin and the Aen Elle warriors vanished, ousted by Ciri's outbreak of power in the wake of Vesemir's death.[1]In the battle's aftermath, Eskel bid a last farewell to his valiant master. Unable to imagine Kaer Morhen without Vesemir, he decided to watch over the Witchers' Settlement until winter 1273 and return to the Path for an unknown amount of time. Direction—Lormark. He supposed its warlike undertone would provide ample work opportunities.[1]In July 1267, Ciri experienced a pyromantic vision with a fraction of it showing Eskel and other witchers led onto a scaffold.[10] She had seen Eskel again in a different vision after entering Tor Zireael.[11] When recounting the story about Yennefer, Geralt and herself to Galahad, Ciri changed the end to a happy one, telling the naive knight from another world that, after the pogrom, a splendid feast took place with Eskel in attendance.[3]Elsewhere, bard Dandelion introduced a ballad Bitter, Evil Hearts, chronicling the tale of Eskel and Ademeyn.[5] A story about how Eskel saved the little girl from a Basilisk made it into A Few Remarks on Basilisks and Cockatrices, a book containing useful knowledge for beast hunters.[1] Decades on, by the 14th century, he had become a part of various iterations of the legend of the White Wolf and the witcher girl.[3]Eskel uses Igni against the Hunt.The Wolf witcher had a menacing, metallic voice that sounded like a dog's barking to Ciri when she first heard it. The most prominent feature of his visage was a long, hideous, semi-circular scar running from the corner of his mouth across the length of his cheek up to the ear. It got itchy when he was nervous or embarrassed. Minus the scar and hair color, Eskel and Geralt resembled one another like true brothers. Eskel's hands emanated powerfully with magic, with more power than the White Wolf's. This triggered pleasant, piercing vibration in mages.[4] On festive occasions, he would sport a beret adorned with pheasant feathers.[12]Eskel was calm, patient, stable, thoughtful and polite. Even when he disagreed wholeheartedly with a topic, he feigned politeness and interest in the matter. What betrayed him in such situations was avoiding eye contact. He enjoyed drinking and laughing with friends. Quite self-aware, he had no delusions about his appearance but that didn't hinder him from smiling. His fitting, mature behavior, especially when it came to Ciri compared to the other witchers endeared him to Triss Merigold.[4] Vesemir prized Eskel's reliability.[13]"

As Yoana felt many would doubt a human, nevertheless female, could be better than a dwarf at forging armor, the two struck a deal for her to act as his assistant. This plan might have worked well, but Fergus refused to believe the master armorer and always waylaid her suggestions in front of others.When the local Nilfgaardian commander came by and ordered a suit of armor that could withstand a shot from a crossbow, Fergus stated it couldn't be done and Yoana, having enough, stated it could actually, with the right tools.If Geralt helps Yoana out and wears the armor: Fergus created shoddy armor and it quickly proved it couldn't withstand a crossbow bolt when tested out. Yoana, having received help in acquiring the right tools to do the job, created a piece of armor that, true to her word, repelled the bolts, showing who the true master armorer was.

Following King Bran's death, this expedition against Myrhyff was Hjalmar's attempt at a heroic deed, one which would allow him to make a claim for Skellige's throne. Thus the warriors who joined the expedition, Folan included, travelled to Undvik.On Undvik, the group encamped and Folan was assigned to night watch. While on duty, he spotted Egnar of Faroe steal Hjalmar's Hornwall horn, which the jarl's son used to drive away sirens. Folan then chased Egnar across the island, all the while shooting the thief with arrows. The pursuit continued through a nekker lair near an abandoned village, and ended when, eventually, Folan caught up with Egnar, who screamed and attracted the attention of some ice trolls from a nearby cave.While Egnar died from injuries inflicted upon him by the arrows, the trolls kidnapped Folan and placed him into a cauldron intending to use him for a stew. Some time later, when Folan was about to be cooked, Geralt of Rivia arrived on Undvik searching for Hjalmar and the missing crew.If Geralt did not find Folan: It is unknown exactly what became of Folan, though it is likely that he was killed and consumed by the ice trolls that kidnapped him.If Geralt found and saved Folan: Geralt followed the trail of footsteps and blood left by Folan's pursuit of Egnar, and came upon the cave where Folan was being held.

During the First Northern War Fringilla fought for Nilfgaard at the Battle of Sodden Hill where she blinded Yennefer who was fighting on the opposing side.When Geralt and his team reached Toussaint, Fringilla embarked on a romantic relationship with Geralt and did everything in her power to keep him from leaving the castle. While the witcher did develop some feelings for her, he never quite was able to put Yennefer out of his mind, even going so far as to use Yennefer's name instead of Fringilla's in the throes of passion.In Nilfgaard, Fringilla was approached by Assire var Anahid who offered her the chance to become a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. While initially surprised by Assire's appearance, since Assire never really put effort into her appearance before, Assire pointed out that Fringilla had always been one to put effort into her own looks, noting that among Nilfgaardian mages Fringilla didn't care about their stereotypes (as Nilfgaard believed mages that focused on their looks were superficial).

The witcher voiced his objection at this and so the ealdorman and a couple other villagers claimed they had hid the rest of the gold in the barn and led him out there to get the rest of the payment. However, it proved to be a trap where the group tried to murder the witcher and only at the last minute when Gaetan realized something was awry did he narrowly avoid being fatally pierced by a pitchfork. Still injured and now incensed at this, Gaetan went on a killing spree, blindly killing every villager for trying to cheat and kill him, whether they were guilty or not.

"489","Gaunter O'Dimm",NA,"Male",NA,NA,"Gaunter O'Dimm, sometimes called Master Mirror or Man of Glass, was a powerful individual, creating pacts with people in exchange for their souls and being able to control time with a mere clap of his hands.Not much is known about Gaunter before his meeting with Geralt, but he stated that he was a former mirror merchant-turned-mangy vagrant because of the war.[1]In May 1272, Gaunter O'Dimm visited the inn of White Orchard, and was approached by the witcher Geralt, who was searching for Yennefer. O'Dimm asked to buy the witcher a drink, and that he knew about Geralt and Yennefer based off Dandelion's ballads.Pushing for an answer, Geralt continued asking whether he had seen Yennefer, so O'Dimm told him local rumours he had heard and advised him to go to the nearby Nilfgaardian Garrison nearby to continue his search. He remarked that he didn't need a reward as one day he may need Geralt's help and then suddenly disappeared.[1]When a captive Geralt was on a ship en route to Ofier to await execution for unknowingly killing the Ofieri Prince, Gaunter O'Dimm mysteriously appeared. He offered to help free Geralt in exchange for a small favor. When Geralt agreed, O'Dimm burned a mark on his face as a sign of their bargain. He then caused a storm to destroy the ship and gave Geralt an opening to escape.The two later reunited at O'Dimm's rendezvous point at the crossroads of Yantra at midnight. There, O'Dimm contracted Geralt into helping him finish up a different contract: to grant three wishes to the immortal Olgierd, telling him once the wishes have been granted he will free Geralt of his pact.O'Dimm reappeared when Geralt went to confront Olgierd. As it turned out, their pact required a proxy to fulfill Olgierd's wishes. After Olgierd gave Geralt his first two wishes (to show his brother Vlodimir the time of his life and to bring him Maximilian Borsodi's house) O'Dimm appeared before Geralt, offering his help as the contract did not forbid it. He informed Geralt that Vlodimir was already deceased and thus provided a vial of von Everec blood to perform a Blood Summoning. However, he refused to make things easy on Geralt, telling him to rely on his wit and intelligence when it came to Maximilian Borsodi's house.Gaunter O'Dimm's true identity remained a mystery throughout most of the story, though he appeared to be a powerful being as he could take souls, grant wishes, see things for their true nature, cause ghosts pain, and could manipulate time itself, making Geralt increasingly suspicious of the true nature of O'Dimm. Despite asking who he is, O'Dimm refused to reveal his true name to Geralt, warning him that those who learned it suffered a terrible fate. While seemingly almost untouchable, Geralt did learn that O'Dimm had one weakness: he loved to make deals with anyone who asked as long as the payment was their soul. Playing into this, he will also take up challenges where one's soul is at stake, as he almost always won (with the exception of one person who had beaten him at his own game).However, his deals were often filled with conditions and wordplay loopholes through which O'Dimm could claim payment, apparently often Faustian in nature. The clearest example of this trickery was shown with one Professor Premethine Shakeslock: O'Dimm granted him physical protection but forced him to remain within a spell diagram, caused mental damage with dreams and visions, and then set a trap to kill Shakeslock should he ever leave the circle.Through the tasks Olgierd made him do, Geralt learned that Olgierd had previously made a pact with O'Dimm for the restoration of his wealth and power so that he could once again be of nobility and marry his noble-born love. However, O'Dimm delighted in difficult decisions and made Olgierd choose between sacrificing Iris or Vlodimir before granting his wish; Olgierd chose his brother, causing him to die the next day. However it was shown that as a ""side effect"" of his fulfilled desires, Olgierd had developed a heart of stone: losing his capacity for any emotions over time, culminating in the eventual death of his wife.After fulfilling Olgierd's final wish, Geralt encountered O'Dimm again at the Alchemy tavern where he was stopped by a drunk patron inviting him to drink, which caused O'Dimm to lose his patience and stop time itself so he could have a chat with the witcher. Through questioning, O'Dimm told Geralt that he was neither demon nor djinn and that it was not his fault that the negative intentions of his clients caused them to suffer, explaining to Geralt that he gave people exactly what they wished for. When questioned about who he was O'Dimm became deadly serious and told Geralt that those who know his name had either gone mad or had died and he was showing the witcher mercy by not telling him. He ordered Geralt to bring Olgierd to a meeting at the Temple of Lilvani to complete their deal, then killed the interrupting drunkard with a spoon through the eye on his way out before restoring the flow of time.Looking for more information on O'Dimm, Geralt, thanks to Shani's help, eventually found the Professor Shakeslock in Oxenfurt Academy, where he had cloistered himself in his house out of fear of what he had discovered. He told the witcher that Olgierd had hired him to research O'Dimm's identity and to figure out how Olgierd might get rid of him. He had ""pored over countless tomes, delved into obscure incidents and analyzed folk legends"" and came to believe that, in short, O'Dimm was ""Evil Incarnate.""He further explained that O'Dimm was just one of many names belonging to the entity, a record of whose presence could be traced back thousands of years and across different cultures, and was a being who appeared to relish in meddling with human affairs, taking their souls, and sowing misfortune. However, O'Dimm had one weakness: he could be tempted into pacts where one's soul is at stake and he must always keep his end of the bargain.The professor revealed that simply studying about O'Dimm had caused him to go blind, which had in turn attracted the attention of O'Dimm himself. O'Dimm had then drawn the professor a magical circle of protection as a reward of sorts, telling him that he would be safe as long as he remained in the circle. However, he then made the ceiling brace above the circle weaken, creating a death trap for the professor should he leave the circle. Geralt managed to get the information he wanted out of the professor who proclaimed that he felt happy just to be useful again. This reaction corresponded to the failure of the ceiling brace, causing structural damage and shaking the walls with enough force to cause a bookcase to fall. Geralt managed to hold the bookcase upright but the professor tripped over a bottle as he backed away, causing him to fall outside the circle and to break his neck on a small pile of books, instantly killing him.O'Dimm greeted both Geralt and Olgierd at the temple ruins by walking down from the sky, telling Olgierd that he is here for his soul as agreed. Olgierd disputed this by stating that O'Dimm can only claim his soul as per the agreement by granting him three wishes through a third party and for him to ""be standing upon the moon"" which Olgierd thought to be impossible. Still grinning wickedly, O'Dimm revealed that through Geralt he has done the three wishes and, with a gesture, blowed away the dust and dirt off the temple grounds to reveal an old tile floor with a design of the moon, thus fulfilling his side of the bargain evidenced by the contract itself bursting into flames. At this point Geralt could do one of two things:""You are insignificant. You think you've defeated me but you are wrong. I can't be killed, I will be back.""(Translated from O'Dimm's speech)Geralt initially concluded that the answer to the riddle is ""mirror"" and eventually managed to find a palace of mirrors, though O'Dimm altered the landscape while causing each mirror he approached to shatter, all the while mocking Geralt and speaking confidently of his victory. After several attempts, Geralt was able to reason through the problem and came to the realization that he needed to find an unbreakable mirror and released a dammed pool for a water fountain in order to look at himself on the water's surface. As he looked down, he saw O'Dimm hiding in his reflection and pulled him out of the water, which revealed O'Dimm to have eyes like a snake while his cheek and jaw bones become demonic. O'Dimm spoke to the witcher in three languages deriving from another world before being banished as agreed.[2]By the end of the third war, when Geralt rode through White Orchard again, one of the five remaining dwarves from the Isle of Mists mentioned O'Dimm as ""Mr. Mirrory or something like that"", the recipient of a chalice they had lifted from someone.[1]"

Rather than calling the guards, he heard what Geralt and Avallac'h had to say, and agreed to return with them back to Novigrad. When they arrived, they had Corinne Tilly use her power of oneiromancy to reveal Eredin's treachery. Once the dream ended, Ge'els advised them to fight Eredin in their own world, and to lure him there using the Sunstone on Skellige.

"493","Geralt of Rivia TV series Games","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher"," Wolf School","Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir. As his first choice, Geralt chose ""Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde"", but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so ""Geralt"" was all that remained of his chosen name. ""Of Rivia"" was a more practical alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic. Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga conferring on him the formal title ""of Rivia"", which amused him.[1] He, therefore, became a true knight.Geralt was the son of the sorceress Visenna and, presumably, the warrior Korin, but when he was born Visenna left him with the School of the Wolf at Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was trained and made to be a witcher. He survived the many blistering mutations required to grant witchers their abilities and passed the Trial of the Grasses. Geralt's intensive training and the mutagenic experimentation carried out upon him, granted him considerably greater strength, speed, endurance, resilience, healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and extreme resistance to pain.Geralt was eventually put through the Trial of Forest Eyes, where he was left tied up in the woods and blindfolded and needed to return to the keep by the morning or he would fail. He was helped out of his binds by the elf Aideen, where they went to look at the non-human reservation to find the camp had been attacked by vrans. They then left and came across some Cat School witchers training and wrestling. Aideen then unbound Geralt and left him to return to his master.Later on, the Wolf School and the Cat School had a tournament between them, organized by King Radowit II who secretly plotted with the Cat School to kill the witchers from the Wolf School. In the first round, Geralt and Gweld faced off, slowly realizing while they were fighting that the whole tournament was a ruse. As they came to that realization however, a druid put a mind control spell upon Gweld which made him violently attack Geralt, forcing Geralt to kill his friend with a sword through the chest. Right after this, soldiers under Radowit's command surrounded the witchers and started to kill them all, but Geralt was able to escape on horseback, causing Radowit to put a bounty on his head.Geralt then came across Aideen again in the woods, who persuaded him not to kill the soldiers who slaughtered his fellow witchers, though he did kill one of Radowit's men that he saw along his trip back to Hertch, where he warned the elders about Radowit and the Cat School's betrayal.[2]Due to his brilliant success in training, Geralt was selected for additional mutation experiments. He was the only witcher to have survived these experiments, his stark white hair being a side effect of these additional mutations. After finishing his witcher training, Geralt set off into the world on a horse named Roach, a name he would bestow upon every one of his later horses. Thus, he became a monster slayer for hire.After about 50 miles after leaving Kaer Morhen, Geralt was anxious to kill his first monster. He came across a bald man with rotten teeth, alongside his mates, who were about to rape a young girl. The bald man prepared to rape her as his mates held back her father until Geralt came in and killed the bald man, which frightened the gang off. The young witcher expected thanks, though the reality of the situation soon set in: not only did the father flee with the gang, but the girl, with the bald man's blood on her, threw up, became hysterical, and then passed out when Geralt approached her.An unknown time later, he killed an amphisbaena and went to the court of King Idi of Kovir, where he handed in the head of the beast. However the king's mages, Zavist and Stregobor, told the king that Geralt was little more than a charlatan, so the king didn't pay the witcher anything and demanded he leave Kovir in 12 hours, which Geralt was barely able to do on account of the king's hourglass being broken.Two years later he made his way to Blaviken where the alderman, Caldemeyn, was happy to see the witcher after so many years since Geralt's last visit. While he couldn't offer a reward on a kikimore that Geralt killed nearby, his guards suggested the local mage, Irion, might have some use for it. However, when they arrived at the mage's tower, Geralt immediately saw Irion was actually none other than Stregobor. Once the witcher and mage were alone, the two discussed the past, with Geralt sardonically remarking on how Stregobor talked the former King Idi out of paying him back in Kovir. Pushing this aside, Stregobor revealed he needed Geralt's help: Renfri, a bandit and the leader of a gang, was in town looking to kill him, and therefore he wished for the witcher to kill Renfri. Unfazed by this, Geralt remarked it wasn't his problem and left.Later that night, Geralt and Caldemeyn went to The Golden Court, the town's inn and where Renfri was staying. Geralt found her gang sans leader, but none of them were very cooperative and just made jokes until one member, Fifteen, challenged him to a fight. However, before it could begin, Renfri appeared and went to talk to Geralt and Caldemeyn in private, with the latter demanding she leave town or be thrown in jail. Unperturbed, Renfri revealed a letter of safe conduct from King Audoen which gave her immunity in Hengfors and Arcsea and after another short discussion, Geralt and the alderman left.That night, as Geralt went to his guest room in Caldemeyn's home, he found Renfri there, who eventually revealed her entire past, including how Stregobor played a part in banishing the princess from her own kingdom on account of her being born during a black sun, setting into play a constant struggle between the two: her trying to kill the mage and the mage trying to kill her. She then asked Geralt to help her kill Stregobor, but the witcher once again refused to take sides. After telling her she should leave town, Renfri remarked on the Tridam ultimatum, before agreeing she'd leave the next day, but in the meantime wished to sleep with Geralt, who obliged.The next morning though, as Geralt ate breakfast with Caldemeyn and his family, the alderman revealed the deadly meaning behind the Tridam ultimatum, making Geralt realize Renfri's ruse was to take the market-goers hostage and he ran off to the market, which was preparing for its busiest day of the year. When he arrived, he found Renfri's gang, who hadn't acted yet as Renfri went off to give Stregobor the ultimatum first. Not wanting to take chances, Geralt fought with the gang, viciously killing them all off in front of the townspeople before Renfri showed up, who refused to stand down, forcing Geralt to fight and kill her as well. As she died, Stregobor appeared, having seen it all from his crystal ball, and wished to do an autopsy on the dead princess. However, Geralt threatened to slay the mage if he so much as touched Renfri's body, and thus Stregobor left to return to Kovir. The townspeople, not realizing how close they'd come to being hostages and killed off, proceeded to throw stones at Geralt for his actions until Caldemeyn stepped in to stop it. He then asked for Geralt to leave and never return to Blaviken.[3]As Geralt left the tent, he was approached by Merwin, who showed him a scroll from King Henselt of Kaedwen, who told him that Merwin was under the protection of Kaedwen and anyone defying Merwin defied the kingdom. Shortly after in the woods Geralt met Lambert, who had just killed some wolves and explained that Merton Bringgs and his group of dwarves had tried to enter the keep, but Lambert caught them. As Geralt entered the keep, he found Vesemir who informed him that Deidre had returned a couple days earlier, running from her envious brother and an evil sorceress, and that Eskel had told him that Deidre was actually his surprise child from about 20 years ago. Vesemir then told Geralt to go look for Eskel.Geralt soon found Eskel, who explained how Deidre had become his surprise child, but ultimately hadn't decided if he should hand her over to Sabrina or not. The who then made their way back to Vesemir, who decided the 4 should vote on it, with it coming down to Geralt's choice as Eskel chose to trust whatever his fellow witcher decided.If Geralt voted to keep Deidre safe: Geralt and Eskel convinced Deidre to go with them to the camp where the prince and the sorceress were. Once there though, despite Deidre agreeing she'd give up any claim to the throne and any titles and estates like her brother wanted, Sabrina then tried to have Merton arrest her. In the ensuing chaos, Deidre struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and killed Merton with her sword but Sabrina escaped through a portal. The witchers then entered a fight with Merwin's group before Geralt followed Deidre into Sabrina's tent where he found Deidre, Sabrina, and Merwin. Merwin asked Geralt to kill Deidre, but she pleaded for her life saying she didn't mean to hurt Eskel. Geralt then tried to convince Deidre to let her anger towards Sabrina and her brother go, as that was best for everyone.If Geralt told Deidre to leave the keep: Geralt and Eskel informed Deidre she had to leave, with Eskel explaining she was putting Kaer Morhen in danger by being there. Angry at this, she struck Eskel, causing deep facial scars, and summoned archespores, which attacked the two witchers while she ran off. After dealing with the immediate threats, Geralt informed Vesemir about the situation before going to Sabrina to get her help to heal Eskel, and giving the sorceress permission to hunt down Deidre.The rest of the winter at Kaer Morhen passed more peacefully and Geralt left come spring to continue his trade.[4]Geralt traveled to Gulet on witcher business, where he met Dandelion, a poet who later became his best friend, at a fête. Later Dandelion slept with a woman under the musicians' podium, who had four large brothers. Dandelion fled from the city with Geralt and started to build a friendship with him on their way southeast to Dol Blathanna.[3]After Gulet, Geralt and Dandelion stopped in Upper Posada to look for work, however the only ""monster troubles"" the people could come up with were tall tales and creatures that didn't actually exist, so the two soon left to find another place for work. However, on the road they were soon approached by Nettly, who'd seen them in Upper Posada, and explained he did have business for the witcher, who accepted.Geralt and Dandelion ate supper at the man's house where the group was joined by Dhun, the elder of Lower Posada, who eventually discussed a ""deovel"" named Torque, who had been somewhat helpful, if occasionally pulling pranks on the villagers, but now thing were getting out of hand and they needed something to get rid of Torque, but not kill him.Agreeing to check it out, the witcher and bard went into the nearby hemp field where the ""deovel"" was known to stay and found ""offerings"" set up for the creature. As they looked around, Torque appeared but as Geralt tried to talk with the sylvan, Dandelion started to make jokes at Torque to the point the sylvan began to pelt small, iron balls at the two, making the two runoff.After the attack, the two went back to Lower Posada where they met with Dhun and Nettly, who admitted that they had tried to outwit the ""deovel"" in the past, including trying to trick him into eating the iron pellets he'd thrown at the pair. Eventually, they brought out an old woman and her apprentice, Lille, along with an ancient book. While the old woman, a Wise One, couldn't read the book, she'd memorized it by heart from knowledge passed down to each wise woman, eventually revealing Torque was a sylvan and the reason they just wanted to drive him away was that Lille didn't want him killed.With this in mind, the next day Geralt found Torque and, after a quick game of riddles, the witcher threw an iron ball which hit Torque in the forehead. This surprise attack gave Geralt the opportunity to capture Torque and signal to Dandelion, but a horse appeared and hit him, rendering the witcher unconscious.Shortly after, Geralt woke up to find himself tied up along with Dandelion, with Torque giving Galarr, an elf from the Blue Mountains, three sacks of corn, revealing that Torque had been stealing the food to help the starving elves, as well as passing along agricultural tips he learned from the villagers as the elves didn't know how to farm the land. Noticing the awake prisoners, one of the elves, Toruviel, began to antagonize Geralt before kicking him and smashing Dandelion's lute. Angry at this latter act, Geralt managed to headbutt the elf and another moved to kill the witcher despite Torque's protests that Filavandrel aén Fidháil forbade killing, when Filavandrel himself showed up to stop everything.However, it was clear that the leader planned to have the witcher and bard killed, as they were witnesses to what Torque had been doing, though during this Filavandrel and Geralt conversed, with Geralt noting the elf was filled with hatred towards humans and, despite how his people were starving, too proud to try and cohabit with those he deemed ""inferior"". As the elves moved to shoot Geralt and Dandelion though, Torque stood in front of the pair, fruitlessly trying to defend anyone from being killed and ignoring Geralt's remark to stand aside. Feeling it was necessary, Filavandrel started to give the order to kill the three when Lille suddenly appeared, but in the form of the goddess Dana Meadbh. After silently communicating with the elves, she sent them riding back to the Blue Mountains, but not before Toruviel gave Dandelion her priceless lute for destroying his. Filavandrel then bade farewell to them, remarking Geralt was right about his earlier comments. Later that night, Geralt, Dandelion, and Torque made camp, with Geralt reading over the ancient book he'd collected as his prize for getting rid of Torque, who was moving on from Lower Posada.[3]An unknown time later, Geralt and Dandelion traveled to a village where they went fishing but the line snapped and their meal escaped. The two started to fight about who was at fault and started to leave before Dandelion realized the line had caught an old jar that he thought might contain a djinn. On realizing there was a mage's seal on the jar, Geralt tried to warn the bard not to touch it but in their scuffle, the seal came off and the djinn appeared. As Geralt grabbed his swords, Dandelion began to make wishes, which only angered the djinn and it grabbed Dandelion's throat. With his weapons doing little damage, Geralt grabbed the seal out of desperation and used the words of an exorcism a priestess had taught him and miraculously the djinn ran off.However, the bard was badly injured so Geralt hastily made for Rinde in hopes of finding someone to help. Despite Dandelion's severe injuries, anyone of low stature wasn't allowed to enter after sunset so all they could do was wait it out with the others there, including Chireadan, Errdil, and Vratimir. Eventually the group revealed there was only one known mage in town who could help: Yennefer of Vengerberg who, despite King Heribert's orders that no magic users could stay in Redania, was staying with the honorary Novigrad ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus giving her asylum while she stayed with him.As soon as sunrise hit, Geralt made his way to the ambassador's home, knocking out the doorman, Cerberus, in the process. While he searched the home for the sorceress, he ran into a drunk and naked Berrant, who mentioned a woman wanting juice before he passed out. Geralt got the apple juice, then made his way up to the sorceress' room and gave her the drink, who didn't notice at first that he was not Berrant as she was under the bed covers. However, once she appeared naked from under them, she quickly realized the situation and demanded answers from Geralt, who answered sarcastically, causing her to immediately cast a spell at him which Geralt tried to counter with Heliotrop. Desperate for her help, Geralt changed to a respectful tone, explaining why he'd intruded on her sleep, before eventually revealing the djinn and the exorcism statement he made. However, Yennefer remarked it wasn't an exorcism, just a witty, indecent comment before asking what drove the djinn away and the seal that'd been on the bottle. While Geralt noted it probably went to do one of Dandelion's wishes, he hid the truth about the seal, pretending Dandelion had it. The two then traveled by portal to Errdil's inn so that Yennefer could help the injured bard.As Yennefer worked on healing Dandelion, Geralt and Chireadan discussed the sorceress, with the two men both revealing in their own ways they found her attractive, though the elf noted that Geralt should be wary of Yennefer, as she didn't do things to help others unless she was also getting something out of it. After some time, Yennefer then called the witcher up to the room to see Dandelion only to then release a magical trap on Geralt and revealing she knew he had the seal. After some back and forth comments, Geralt gave it to her as a gesture of goodwill that he'd pay her for her help, however this was fruitless as Yennefer had something else in mind and Geralt quickly deduced she wanted to use Dandelion, who had a connection to the djinn, to try and lure it back to capture it for herself. The witcher adamantly refused to put Dandelion in danger again, but by then Yennefer's other spells took hold, paralyzing the witcher and obscuring the room in a magical shield so nobody could interfere. With that, she then told Geralt he was going to pay for her help by settling some of her accounts in Rinde before violently kissing him, which placed a hypnotic spell on the witcher before he soon lost conscious.Geralt woke to find himself in the city's dungeons with Chireadan, who revealed in his mind-controlled state that Geralt had beat up the local pawnbroker and his apprentice, spanked the local apothecary Laurelnose, took out a group of guards, then made his way to the temple while insulting the priest, Krepp, as all 3 were on the town council and had voted to kick Yennefer out of Rinde while also spreading vulgar gossip about her. However, before Geralt could make it to the temple he fainted and the guards threw him into the dungeons, with Chireadan having been caught in the chaos and thrown in as well. Just then, several guards sent by Laurelnose came in and began to beat up Geralt, but when the one throwing the punches asked if the witcher had any wishes, Geralt stated he just had one: that the guard would burst and, before another punch could be thrown, the guard's body literally burst, killing him instantly.With that, Geralt and Chireadan were brought before the mayor, Neville, with Krepp also in attendance, with the latter noting it must have been the sorceress' work as neither the witcher or elf had control of the force to do so. After revealing almost the entire story to the mayor and priest, Krepp then concluded Yennefer wanted the djinn as it would give the sorceress a great deal of power and when the conversation turned to what Geralt said that made the genie run off, Geralt repeated the supposed exorcism only for Krepp to become insulted by it. Before more could be asked on this, Dandelion suddenly fell into the room through a portal, proclaiming Geralt was innocent and that Yennefer had ordered him to state before the mayor his wish was for them to believe the witcher wasn't guilty. Krepp quickly deduced it was the sorceress' way of using the last wish to free the genie so she could capture it when the group heard a thunderous noise outside of the building and looked out to see the djinn flying above Errdil's tavern, having being magically lassoed by Yennefer. However, the djinn wasn't going down without a fight and was destroying all the nearby buildings as it tried to break free.Wishing to save Yennefer, Geralt got Krepp to cast a spell to re-open the portal Dandelion had come through but not before asking what the words of the exorcism he said earlier meant, to which Krepp paraphrased that it meant ""get out of here and go fuck yourself!"". With that, Geralt entered the portal and landed in Errdil's tavern and where Yennefer was still trying to capture the genie while her powers waned. Seeing Geralt, she opened a portal to send him away as the djinn entered the tavern through its own portal to kill the sorceress, but Geralt threw himself between the two, shielding Yennefer. Shockingly, the genie didn't attack the witcher, but appeared to roar in an unknown language at him. Trying to get Yennefer away from it, Geralt pulled the sorceress through the portal she'd opened, though she yelled and threw punches at the witcher, claiming she almost had the genie, before rushing back through the portal with Geralt trying to grab her once more. As they crashed back in the tavern, Yennefer managed to cast a spell to pin the witcher down, but Geralt, trying to save her, informed her of the truth: he was the one making the wishes as he'd been the one holding the seal when he made his first wish (the ""exorcism"") and had one wish left.As a weakened Yennefer demanded Geralt make his last wish so she could hopelessly try to capture the genie, Geralt finally realized what he wanted and that would also save Yennefer from the genie's wrath and wished their fates be tied, thus freeing the genie while preventing it from killing the sorceress. With that, the genie escaped back to its realm and Geralt and Yennefer proceeded to make love in the destroyed tavern.[3]After the events in Rinde, Yennefer and Geralt started a rather physical relationship, spending the majority of their time at Yennefer 's home in Vengerberg, Aedirn, and putting to good use a wide variety of the sorceress' collection, including a stuffed unicorn, as well as having sex in rather unusual situations, like levitating 30 fanthoms above ground. However, the witcher finally decided to leave after half a year in the city, considering Yennefer's behavior as too possessive. Unable to initiate the parting though, the witcher ran off during the night, leaving only a rose and a letter on the bed as his farewell.TBAA while later, Geralt traveled to Vizima and visited The Fox but, while in the process of trying to find a bed to rent, was attacked by three racists who didn't approve of his Rivian accent. A short fight unfolded where Geralt killed the men but right after members of the city guard appeared and attempted to arrest him, though using Axii, Geralt was able to manipulate them into taking him to Velerad, the city castellan, instead.Once he met Velerad, the pair took time discussing the real reason Geralt was passing through: King Foltest of Temeria had put out a contract to cure his daughter, Adda the White, who was cursed and turned into a striga. After Geralt went and saw Foltest, and they reached an agreement: for 3,000 orens, Geralt would try to successfully release Adda from her curse, without killing her, as many had attempted in the past. The witcher then discussed the plan further with Foltest's underlings, Ostrit, Velerad, and Segelin, who agreed the witcher should spend a night in the old city with the striga.Four days later, after talking to survivors of the beast, speaking further with Foltest, and finalizing plans, Geralt traveled to the old, abandoned palace and set up camp there, preparing his potions and meditating before he was found by Ostrit in the dead city. The magnate then tried to bribe the witcher with 1,000 orens to leave the place and never return, all while keeping the cursed Adda in her form. As Geralt questioned Ostrit's reasoning, noting a striga on the loose would make people lose faith in their king and possibly remove Foltest, the magnate grew frustrated and tried to fight the witcher, who quickly knocked out the man and tied him up.Ostrit came to shortly after and soon realized Geralt planned to use him as bait to lure out Adda. He then confessed to the witcher he did want to overthrow Foltest, but more than that, he wanted the king to suffer because Foltest had taken the one Ostrit had loved, Adda of Temeria, who was the king's own deceased sister and lover. However, he was adamant he couldn't have possibly caused the curse as he didn't know how to use magic and that Foltest and Adda's mother, Sancia of Sodden, must have done it as she too didn't agree with the incestous relationship. Geralt, however, heard the beast start to move out of her crypt and cut the magnate loose, who quickly took off to try and fruitlessly escape, but was quickly killed by the striga.Geralt and the striga then faced off against each other, though Geralt took care not to kill her, only looking to buy enough time to get her away from her crypt. Eventually managing to send her running, Geralt quickly hid himself in her tomb and closed it, casting Yrden on the cover before meditating until dawn. Awaking a few hours later, right at dawn, he slipped out of the tomb to find Adda, now in human form, lying next to the tomb. However, as Geralt checked her teeth to make sure the transformation was complete, the still transforming girl awoke and slashed deep cuts in Geralt's neck with her talons. The witcher quickly pinned her down until she completely transformed back to human, but right after Geralt fainted from the blood loss.Two days later, Geralt woke up in the new palace with Velerad looking after him, who explained they'd raced into the old palace right after dawn and found the badly injured witcher and saved him. Geralt then asked about the princess' condition and as the castellan explained she was fine, Geralt fell asleep once more.[3]After fighting and releasing the striga, Geralt traveled to Ellander to recover at the Temple of Melitele. He was cared to by and quickly developed a relationship with one of the priestesses, Iola, who was studying under Nenneke, who he ended up sleeping with, as she reminded him of Yennefer. The next morning, the two were arose by Nenneke, who didn't want them in a relationship together, so she sent Iola out to continue with her duties. The older priestess had a look at Geralt's injuries and then after some assessment, sent the witcher to go eat breakfast, before joining him again in the temple gardens.The two then discussed Iola using magic to put Geralt in a trance, and maybe reveal something about his destiny and future, though the witcher didn't want to undergo such a thing. Not long after that, Count Falwick and Arthur Tailles, members of the Order of the White Rose, arrived at the temple and confronted Geralt and Nenneke, asking the witcher to leave Ellander by the orders of Duke Hereward. Tailles' attitude was met by Nenneke who declared the temple belonged to her and she decided who came and left, threatening the young knight with a small porcelain jar that was potentially harmful. Geralt decided to tell the men of his plans to leave Ellander in the next few days and adding insult to injury, started to insult Tailles, who furiously left the temple with his partner.Geralt later went and saw Iola, explaining Kaer Morhen and his training as a witcher, as well as contracts he had taken throughout his life on the path. After spending some time alone and reading, Geralt was informed by Nenneke that Dandelion was at the temple to visit him, just before the poet turned around the corner. The two discussed recent events and Dandelion's education before the witcher bought out vodka and they started to drink, with Geralt complaining about a lack of work in the area. After his drink with Dandelion, Geralt went to the grotto in the garden and had a look at the many exotic herbs there while Nenneke harvested them. She asked him to stay a couple more days at the temple, which request was quickly turned down by the witcher, as he was preparing to leave that day.After leaving the temple with Dandelion, the witcher started to ride towards the city of Ellander before he was confronted by Falwick, Tailles and Dennis Cranmer, with Falwick declaring the young knight and the witcher must fight, as Tailles' pride had been injured at the temple. Falwick then informed Geralt that he had to throw the fight, as hitting the knight would have him arrested and thrown in front of Hereward. Geralt agreed to the fight and easily outmanoeuvred the young knight, making him hit himself in the face, which Falwick believed was worth Cranmer arresting Geralt according to his orders, but the dwarf believed that Tailles had hit himself and that wasn't worth arresting the witcher for. As Geralt prepared to leave, he threatened Falwick, saying if he ever threatened Nenneke or Cranmer again, he would die for it.The two headed back to the temple, where he prepared to travel, packing up his horse and saying his goodbyes. Iola came out and gave him his elixirs and after their hands touched, she started to suffer a seizure, which Nenneke told Geralt to ignore and leave, which he did.[3]TBAA while later, Geralt and Yennefer traveled to the city of Aedd Gynvael in Narok, and during their stay in the city, Geralt took on a contract on a nasty zeugl that had infested the sewers. While fighting the beast, he got stuck in a rubbish heap and was dragged through the filth, and after striking the killing blow, the beast's slime and bile spilled all over the witcher, adding to his stench.In May 1272, Geralt and Vesemir were headed to the village of Willoughby, following the instructions of a recent letter from Yennefer, who they were tracking. They stopped in White Orchard, hearing news that Willoughby had been burnt to the ground. Following a nightmare about Ciri and the Wild Hunt, Geralt rode with Vesemir to a ford, where they encountered the merchant Bram being attacked by a royal griffin, which they drove off. After arriving at the White Orchard inn, they spoke with the innkeep Elsa. Geralt and Vesemir then sat down, before Geralt introduced himself to Gaunter O'Dimm, and then asked about Yennefer, with the merchant stating she had ridden through White Orchard to the Nilfgaardian Garrison.After riding to the garrison, Geralt met Peter Saar Gwynleve, a Nilfgaardian officer. He told Geralt that he would tell the witcher about Yennefer's location if he killed the griffin plaguing White Orchard. After agreeing, the captain pointed two people who could help him with griffin issue, the hunter Mislav and the herbalist Tomira. Geralt needed to visit Tomira, to find out where buckthorn, an aqueous plant that would lure the griffin, grew in the area. She pointed him to the Ismena river, which flowed straight through the center of town. After diving down and obtaining some buckthorn, Geralt headed to Mislav for more information about the griffin, but couldn't find him at his hut, and instead found him hunting in the woods. Mislav asked that the witcher help kill some wild dogs that were attacking villagers, which was an easy job for Geralt, but hard for Mislav, as he found that the dogs had killed his former lord's stable hand. Mislav then took Geralt to the site of where the griffin had attacked some Nilfgaardian soldiers, so Geralt said his thanks and then started to investigate the scene. After following footprints, he came across the creature's nest, in the middle of the Vulpine Woods, with the griffin's female mate lying dead in the nest, killed by Nilfgaardian soldiers, who had provoked the current male griffin to attack.Note: Geralt may have just found the attack sight and buckthorn exploring, without the help of Mislav and Tomira.After preparing for the fight, Geralt returned to the inn and laid the plan out to Vesemir. The two of them set the buckthorn-stuffed sheep in a nearby field, and Vesemir gave Geralt his first ever personal crossbow, before the griffin arrived. The two fought the griffin, even when it flew away to a nearby windmill, until they killed it. Geralt took its head to the garrison, where Peter Saar Gwynleve was whipping the local ealdorman for delivery of rotten grain. After showing the griffin's head, the Nilfgaardian captain told Geralt that Yennefer was in nearby Vizima. Angered at the fact she was less than a day's ride the entire time, Geralt could either accept or decline the coin, before heading back to the inn.Inside the inn with Vesemir, Geralt went to buy provisions for the road, but the atmosphere was very dangerous, with several racists attacking the two witchers after they tried to break up a fight. Killing the men caused Elsa to be disgusted and demand they leave at once, though directly outside the tavern stood Yennefer, with a Nilfgaardian escort, much to Geralt's relief, as he had finally found her. The sorceress explained that Emporer Emhyr var Emreis had summoned Geralt to Vizima, and that he come with her back to the palace. Saying his goodbyes to Vesemir, he rode with them, through to the night when the Wild Hunt attacked the soldiers, Geralt and Yennefer, though the sorceress and witcher were the only to survive thanks to Yennefer's magic.[6]TBAMost of the time, he could be apathetic, cynical, and threatening. Despite his outwardly cold nature, Dandelion noted that behind his exterior was hiding a fiercely loyal friend, and a man of good humour and as someone not indifferent to suffering. Geralt had many good friends all over the Northern Realms, such as Caldemeyn of Blaviken, Zoltan Chivay, and of course Dandelion. He was also very protective of and loyal to his friends and companions, and was willing to go to great lengths for those who mattered to him. He could be kind-hearted and caring to the people he loved.Geralt was also shown to be extremely adept at allaying intense, and at times bleak, situations and as a man who would much sooner have everyone return home than draw their swords. His lifespan made him a world-weary man, often expressing disdain and circuitous insults to those he considered cruel, foolish, etc. He may have risked Temeria's future to save Triss Merigold from the Nilfgaardians. He also was shown requesting Scoia'tael to spare Dandelion and kill only him.Geralt frequently showed remorse and had revelations in his life. Other times he had complete emotional breakdowns, even giving up being a witcher in general and dropping his morals at one point.The story of Geralt and Ciri became a popular saga many years, probably centuries, after the actual events had taken place. The chief sources of these stories were Dandelion's ballads and the bard's autobiography Half a Century of Poetry. However, Dandelion was not fond of telling the whole truth, and ultimately many versions of Geralt's and Ciri's adventures were spread far and wide, including simplified and harmless children's tales, leading scholars to struggle in distinguishing those stories that were considered canon from those that seemed non-canonical and embellished.Many years in the future, the sorceress Nimue verch Wledyr ap Gwyn and her assistant Condwiramurs Tilly conducted extensive research into the matter, in an attempt to determine what had really happened to Geralt and Ciri.After seemingly having been killed by a mob during a pogrom of nonhumans at the end of the Witcher saga, Geralt returns to life with no recollection of the details of his sudden reappearance or of the five intervening years. He is rescued by the last remaining witchers in the world and is taken back to Kaer Morhen. There, he is drawn into a complicated conspiracy concerning the witchers, their secrets, and the nefarious forces that are after that knowledge.Shortly after Geralt's return to Kaer Morhen, an attack is launched on the fortress by an unknown organization, spearheaded by two mages. Though one mage is unknown to her, Triss recognizes the other as Savolla. Geralt provides assistance to his friends in repelling the attack, before Vesemir proclaims that the party must split up as the two mages, having unleashed a frightener in the main courtyard, have descended into the witchers' laboratory to procure the secrets they are in pursuit of. Vesemir offers Geralt the choice of either going after the mages with Triss, or staying to assist the other witchers in defeating the frightener.Later, Leo and Geralt find Triss in an injured state, and descend to the laboratory in order to stop the mages from absconding with the secret formulae. When confronted with the witchers, one of the attackers, namely, The Professor, kills Leo with a crossbow bolt before teleporting away, along with the mages and a sizeable portion of the witchers' writings.During Leo's funeral, Vesemir decides that the attackers, known as Salamandra, must be tracked down and forced to pay for their transgressions. He tells Geralt to use Temeria as a starting point in his search, as he once lifted a curse there from Foltest's daughter.Geralt pursues the mysterious Salamandra, and in the process meets many people from his past, as well as new acquaintances who either require the witcher's help or offer their own in his quest to regain his identity.Vizima is under quarantine due to the Catriona plague, and Geralt cannot enter it as he lacks the necessary letter of safe conduct. Thus, he settles in Vizima's outskirts. During the night, Geralt is attacked by spectral hounds, known as barghests, which were in pursuit of a woman and child. The witcher manages to rescue a boy named Alvin, who levitates and recites Ithlinne's Prophecy in a disturbing voice after the attack, revealing himself to be a Source. Shortly thereafter, Geralt meets Shani, a red-haired medic hailing from Oxenfurt who arrived here to help quell the Catriona epidemic. She decides to place the now-orphaned Alvin under her care. Geralt also meets the alchemist Kalkstein, a trader named Declan Leuvaarden, and Zoltan Chivay, an old friend from Geralt's past life.Geralt seeks out the Reverend, who agrees to assist him in obtaining passage to the city if he fulfils the contract on The Beast, a certain entity which is thought to be responsible for the barghests. The Reverend sends Geralt to assist three pillars of the community: Odo, Mikul, and Haren Brogg.The trader Odo tasks Geralt with weeding out the echinops in his garden after a session of heavy drinking. Mikul sends the witcher to clear the local crypt of ghouls, wherein Geralt discovers the corpse of a poisoned woman. Haren Brogg tasks Geralt with driving away the drowners from his goods by the riverbank. It becomes apparent, however, that Haren is actually a hawker, after a regiment of Scoia'tael attempts to take away the goods Geralt was tasked to protect.The Reverend then offers Geralt to deal with Abigail, a local witch, to whom Shani has now transferred her responsibility over Alvin. The witch carries out a magical procedure in which she attempts to communicate with the spirit of the White Frost in Alvin awakened by the Beast. It confers that the Beast's appearance was caused by the sins of the local residents.Geralt returns to the Inn, wherein he discovers a group of Salamandra fighters assaulting Shani. After dealing with them, the witcher pursues the other members of the Salamandra. Upon reaching their cavernous lair, Geralt discovers Alvin inside who was taken from Abigail's home and turned over to the group by the Reverend and his followers. Further along the cave system, Geralt and Alvin meet Abigail, who asks for the witcher's help in fleeing the enraged crowd that has amassed outside. Geralt makes a choice, either to save Abigail from being lynched, or to leave her to the judgment of the Outskirts' residents. After deciding, he defeats the Beast and the barghests.Later, after receiving a pass into Vizima from the Reverend, or taking it from his corpse, Geralt returns to the Inn, and travels to the city with Shani. However, he is stopped by Mikul at the gates and is turned over to the city guard.The third installment of the trilogy, like its predecessors, follows Geralt through his final adventures. Following the events of Witcher 2, Geralt has regained his memory of the past and prepares to embark on a new journey. In the Witcher 3, Geralt is on the hunt for the only person he considers kin, Ciri. Along his journey, Geralt must face the Wild Hunt in order to protect the people he cares about.In the new open world, Geralt has the opportunity to complete quests that are both part of the main story and side quests. He will also interact with old friends Dandelion and Vesemir along with potential lovers Triss Merigold and Yennefer.Step again into the shoes of Geralt of Rivia, a professional monster slayer. This time travel back to the wilds of Velen and the nooks and alleys of Oxenfurt where he'll try to complete a contract from the mysterious Man of Glass, hired to defeat a ruthless bandit captain and Redanian nobleman, Olgierd von Everec, a man who possesses the power of immortality. Geralt, caught in a thick tangle of deceit, will need all his cunning and strength to solve the mystery and emerge unscathed.As Geralt of Rivia again, travel to a land untainted by war: the Nilfgaardian region of Toussaint, where you will unravel the horrifying secret behind a beast terrorizing the kingdom. With all trails leading to dead ends, only a witcher can solve the mystery and survive the evil lurking in the night as an atmosphere of carefree indulgence and knightly ritual masks an ancient, bloody secret.Geralt is one of the four playable characters in The Witcher: Adventure Game.He is called there ""MONSTER SLAYER - DEADLY IN COMBAT"".[7]Geralt of Rivia was one of playable characters in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins.

Despite this, he held no grudge against Ciri and, when she attended his bedside during his recovery, they fell in love.When Ciri was 10 years old[3] and Hjalmar was 15, they got ""engaged."" Unfortunately their happiness was not to be and Ciri was dragged teary-eyed back to Cintra and a young Hjalmar was left sulking in Skellige.When the Slaughter of Cintra reached the ears of Hjalmar he sought to save his beloved. Alas, when he arrived at Cintra the place was already destroyed and its citizens massacred and Ciri had been taken by Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.Her escape from Cahir then opens up the chapter of her life with Geralt. When Yennefer returned to Skellige to reach Ciri, Hjalmar vowed to go on a ship with her to find his beloved to make up for missing Ciri in Cintra. However, despite volunteering to continue on the longship, Alkyone, which Yennefer planned to use to sail into the infamous Sedna Abyss, she ordered the number to be parsed down to 8, the minimum amount of people needed to keep the ship going for a short time. While she let the captain pick which 8 to transfer, she ordered Hjalmar to stay behind on the second ship, Tamara. When he protested she threatened to tie him to its mast to stay, likely saving his life as it was believed all the crew aboard the Alkyone later drowned or died when it was teleported away.Hjalmar an Craite appears in the final installment of Geralt's trilogy. During the events of the game on Skellige, it is possible for Geralt to help either Cerys or Hjalmar to become the new ruler of the isles."

He was well known for having red hair, a very unusual trait to have for a Nilfgaardian, and which he inherited from his Mag Turga-born father.While stationed at Nilfgaardian Army Group 'Center' Camp in Velen, he'd write home to his mother and fiancée once a week, so when his letters suddenly stopped arriving his mother knew something must have happened to him and showed up at the camp to find out, even if it meant he was dead. However, nobody would speak to her and she could tell the quartermaster, Tavar Eggebracht, was lying, saying her son went scouting and didn't return when she knew he was part of the light cavalry and was thus not a scout.It turns out Hrodeberth was asked to do things that he felt were wrong, like being asked to kill prisoners of war. When he and his group could no longer take it they attempted to desert but the quartermaster found out and hanged the ones they caught while the rest fled into the swamps. Unfortunately for Hrodeberth, he was among those caught and hanged."
"544","Hubert Rejk","Higher vampire[1](Katakan)","Male",NA,NA,"Hubert Rejk was a higher vampire who lived in Novigrad as a coroner in 1272.Little is known about Hubert Rejk's origins. For some time prior to 1242, he taught medicine at the University of Oxenfurt. Among his students was Joachim von Gratz who later became the chief surgeon at Vilmerius Hospital in Novigrad.In 1242, Rejk, dissatisfied with the student revolt at the University which had apparently resulted in the deaths of people who did not share the protesters' values, reported on von Gratz, the leader of the revolt, which landed von Gratz in prison. The people who had been killed in the revolt had allegedly been found in the gutter, with their throats slit from ear to ear with surgical precision. Following these events, Rejk left the University and moved to Novigrad where he found work in the city morgue as a coroner. It was in Novigrad, around the early 1270s that Rejk used his vampiric abilities to murder people which he deemed immoral, those which, in his mind, had strayed from the path of the Eternal Fire. He also began to write and distribute pamphlets across the city under the alias ""Concerned Citizen"" which warned the city's residents against committing heresy.The first victims murdered by Rejk were mainly prostitutes with no friends or families, whose real names are unknown. The first known named victim was Fabian Meyer who was a woodworker producing wooden figures with his brother. Rejk, having arrived at the Meyer's workshop, force-fed the victim with formaldehyde, and performed various mutilations on the victim's body while he was still alive. Furthermore, Rejk carried out some procedures, such as a tracheotomy, to extend Meyer's suffering and ensuring that the victim did not die quickly. He also performed various acts on Meyer that signified fire, such as gouging out Meyer's eyes and replacing them with burning coals, and placing salamander eggs inside his chest after removing the heart. Rejk finally left a letter made of human skin on the victim's body, which stated the name of his next target, the trobairitz Priscilla.Rejk assaulted Priscilla, again with formaldehyde, causing her face and throat to swell up. However, this time he could not finish what he started and was forced to flee, using his superhuman abilities to leap over a large wall and quickly escape. Priscilla was a high-profile target, and this assault attracted the attention of Geralt of Rivia who agreed to help Dandelion, Priscilla's lover, to find and kill the perpetrator.Some time later, Rejk caught Geralt and Joachim von Gratz performing an unauthorized autopsy of Fabian Meyer in the morgue. Shortly after, they were interrupted by Reverend Nathaniel Pastodi, the overseer of the morgue, and Rejk's superior. Rejk covered for Geralt and von Gratz who were forced to leave.Rejk's next victim was Joris Aquinus, a lecturer in theology at Oxenfurt Academy. The details of this murder are unknown, though one distinct aspect of this murder which it had in common with the previous ones was that Aquinus was critical of the Eternal Fire and had many tomes criticizing it. The victim was found in a catafalque made of these books. Rejk, under the pretense of wanting to help Geralt with the investigation into the murders, called the witcher into the morgue for an autopsy of Aquinus, and found a letter of human skin which he himself had planted on the body. This letter named Patricia Vegelbud as the next victim. As Geralt traveled to the Vegelbud Estate in the hopes of preventing another murder, Rejk used his abilities to get there first, murder Patricia Vegelbud and tie her body to the bed, before escaping just as Geralt and Ingrid Vegelbud entered the room. Another letter written on human skin was planted on Vegelbud's body, naming Sweet Nettie at Crippled Kate's brothel as the next victim.However, this was a false trail intended to throw Geralt off track, as Rejk himself actually went to an abandoned warehouse near the Novigrad Docks, while Sweet Nettie was being tortured by Nathaniel Pastodi at the brothel, this being the Reverend's pastime.If Geralt killed Pastodi without speaking to him: Geralt assumed that Pastodi was the murderer and did not pursue the matter further. Rejk went on to kill another victim in Novigrad, before moving to a smaller settlement.If Geralt spoke to Pastodi first: Geralt learned from Pastodi that Rejk was the actual murderer, and went to the warehouse on the docks. It was there that Rejk revealed himself to be a higher vampire, before transforming into a katakan. Rejk was then killed by the witcher."

"551","Imlerith","Elf (Aen Elle)","Male","Commander"," Dearg Ruadhri","Imlerith was one of the generals of the Wild Hunt. He wielded great power, and was one of the most formidable opponents Geralt encountered. Geralt and Imlerith were also acquaintances during Geralt's service with the hunt. The Hunt's second general alongside Imlerith was Caranthir Ar-Feiniel.When Ciri returned to the Continent, Imlerith ordered the Crones to keep an eye out for her. The witches took his order literally as they hung human ears throughout Crookback Bog. When Ciri later teleported to Crookback Bog, she fell into the hands of the Crones but escaped, running back into the woods. Imlerith pursued her on horseback but she managed to evade him.Imlerith later participated in the battle of Kaer Morhen, his presence forcing Geralt's hunting party to retreat. Imlerith gave pursuit, but the witchers made it inside the keep and closed the main gate, to which Imlerith furiously pounded his mace against it.The Hunt eventually broke into the heart of Kaer Morhen, freezing everyone but Ciri and Vesemir. Imlerith engaged the old witcher, enabling Eredin to get a hold of Ciri. Vesemir broke away and stopped Eredin from escaping with Ciri. Imlerith charged at Vesemir, wrapping his hands around his throat just as the witcher pushed Ciri away with Aard. He began strangling Vesemir but ceased at his king's command, to use Vesemir to force Ciri to surrender. Just as Ciri dropped her sword and the Hunt's victory seemed all but assured, Vesemir stabbed Imlerith with a knife. The attack purposefully provoked Imlerith, who proceeded to effortlessly snap Vesemir's neck, killing him. In a grief stricken rage, Ciri unleashed a magical scream that left the Hunt clutching their heads in agony. Imlerith quickly fled through a portal conjured by Caranthir.A few weeks later, Imlerith attended the Sabbath in southern Velen, where he is shown leisurely seated back in a throne accompanied by succubi at his feet. Confronted by Geralt of Rivia, the succubi slowly fled the scene and the mighty Imlerith's unperturbed gaze calmly fixated on the witcher. The elf then presumed to inquire if Ciri was with him. If Geralt chose to lie, Imlerith did not believe him. If Geralt confirmed that Ciri was with him, Imlerith demanded her location but was refused. Either way, Imlerlith rose and donned his helmet, menacing mace, and towering shield before engaging Geralt in combat.Geralt's speed made for a formidable method of combatting the spectre's slower, massive mace swings. Halfway through the battle, Imerlith ditched his giant shield to begin a constant multitude of whirling strikes. Toward the conclusion of the grueling duel, Geralt ran the giant through. Unflinching, with brute strength, Imlerith's mighty hands pounded downward forcing the sword from his body and Geralt's hands. The general then gripped the momentarily staggered Geralt's neck with both hands while he swiftly lifted him in the air. He then asked the witcher who taught him to fight as he did. Geralt responded that it was the witcher he murdered (referencing Vesemir), before force-feeding a devastating Igni blast through the grill of Imlerith's helmet.Consequently, the elf sustained severe burns to his head and neck. As he took off his glowing red-hot helmet and faced death with a devilish smile, Geralt grabbed hold of the monstrous mace and caved in his head from above, finally ending the cruel and sadistic Aen Elle general for good.Imlerith initially starts combat with his massive mace and shield, and he definitely meets the description of ""walking tank"". He is virtually immune to every sign, head-on attacks to his front are almost always blocked and even if you do get past his defenses to get hits in it takes quite a few to put him down. However, his attacks when using his mace one-handed are rather short ranged and cover a narrow area. Your best option for fighting him is to use a short-range Dodge directly past him when he's about to start his attack combo to get behind him (a Roll will put you too far away) and then immediately put 2 hits into his back. Only do 2, he will always parry the third with a spinning shield swipe and stun you. If you then Dodge again straight past him when he does the shield swing you may be able to immediately put another 2 hits in, when he will again do a shield swipe, potentially doing this dodge-double-hit several times in a row. Bombs may also prove very effective, especially Samum, since Imlerith is not immune to blinding.Once he gets a bit past half health he drops his shield and starts using the mace two-handed, as well as teleporting around the battlefield after you. His attacks in this stage are longer range and sweep a wider area, and there is little chance of getting behind him to put hits in while he's in his attack combo. However, after several sets of teleporting attacks he will put one final smash into the ground and then will stay there for a few seconds, winded. This is when you can put several hits into him, where he will then start his attack set again. Keep rolling away during his main attack run and hitting him when he's winded and you should succeed."

She was fond of luxury, despised the dirtiness of the outdoors, and was rather eccentric in nature.In 1267 Keira was serving as King Foltest's advisor when she and other mages in the North learned some of their fellow mages were planning to betray the Brotherhood of Sorcerers for Nilfgaard. Armed with this information, a conclave was called on Thanedd Island under the pretense of figuring out what they should do in regards to their positions as advisors to various rulers. In reality, Keira along with several others, including Philippa Eilhart and Sabrina Glevissig, planned a coup of their own to try and prevent the Nilfgaard supporters from putting their coup into play first.When she attended the banquet the night before the conclave, she met Geralt, who'd been brought along by Yennefer, and the two conversed for a bit, with the witcher joking that he had created the caviar illusion and her noting she didn't want to drink as she planned ""to get pregnant tonight"" before Marti Södergren butted in and the trio discussed trivial matters before Keira walked off to talk with other mages there.However, Keira's real reason for not wanting to drink that night was to prevent herself from falling asleep. While everyone else headed off to bed, the Northern supporters planned to stay awake to arrest the traitors. As dawn approached, they made their move and Keira, with assistance from Sigismund Dijkstra and some of his Redanian soldiers, began to apprehend the traitors. As they were in the process of capturing Artaud Terranova, Geralt stumbled upon them but the soldiers held him off while Terranova was handcuffed, but not before the mage insulted Keira who, in turn, punched him with brass knuckles straight to the face. On seeing Geralt, she demanded that they guard him and hurried off before returning with Detmold, wondering what to do about the witcher. After deciding Philippa could decide, the two mages then hurried off to continue the arrests. A short time later, Keira and Radcliffe apprehended Francesca Findabair and Fercart and brought them to where the rest of the supporters were waiting before moving them to Garstang.However, the plan soon fell apart and a battle erupted between the two sides in Garstang. Keira had been overpowered by them and Terranova proceeded to throw her out of a window but Geralt, who'd been on his way into the tower to find Yennefer, happened to be just below and she instead landed on the witcher. Suffering from a broken leg and ribs, Keira had Geralt carry her so she could show him the way in, meanwhile explaining all that had transpired right before the fight broke out. Keira managed to survive despite her wounds but, having been exiled by her king, took refuge in Montecalvo, Philippa's castle, along with Triss Merigold.[1]In early August, she joined Philippa's plans to create a new mage organization, the Lodge of Sorceresses, attending both the first and second meeting on the 19th of that month. However, like many of the other sorceresses in attendance, she wrongly believed Yennefer had sided with Nilfgaard during the coup and, along with Sabrina, made occasional scathing remarks towards the black-haired sorceress.[2]As January 1268 rolled around, another member of the Lodge, Fringilla Vigo, had seduced Geralt when his travels took him into Toussaint, hoping to keep him there until Spring. However, Geralt learned where Vilgefortz was and proceeded to make haste, but not before Fringilla got him to tell her the location and, in turn, informed the Lodge. Believing they had the upper hand, Keira and Sabrina were sent to ambush the hideout, Rhys-Rhun Castle, to get Ciri, but when they arrived they realized Geralt was smarter than they realized: he had given Fringilla a false location that'd been abandoned for years.[3]Keira Metz was mentioned in a conversation with Cynthia (Iorveth's path). Also her name was one of the names that ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen listed as a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, who were accused of being behind the deaths of both Demavend and Foltest. She was condemned to death with the other members of the Lodge.In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Keira Metz was in hiding, fearing the wrath of the witch hunters. She was first encountered while pretending to be a witch in the village of Midcopse. After spotting Geralt outside her cottage, Keira retreated to a secret, magically-generated chamber. She called out to Geralt from the top of a magic bath, and, when he arrived, coyly presented the witcher with a view of her nude form. From there, her and Geralt traveled to underground elven ruins near Duén Hen to look for Ciri. After wandering round in the dark, they encountered the Wild Hunt. One of the Wild Hunt warriors, Nithral, attacked them, and after defeating him, Keira and Geralt continued to find the mysterious elf's hideout. Throughout her involvement in The Witcher 3, Keira kept up a subtle, sexually-charged rapport with Geralt.In combat, Keira made use of her air magic, utilizing lightning bolts and levitation spells to battle multiple enemies.While Keira was in Velen, she acted like an alchemy shopkeeper and would buy and sell related items; she also offered these services at Kaer Morhen prior to the battle against the Wild Hunt:Due to a glitch, if Geralt returns to Kaer Morhen after having left it during Blood on the Battlefield, Keira's alchemist icon will be visible in a remote part of the map; once reached, she once again acts like an alchemist shop. However there is no way to get back into Kaer Morhen once she is reached as the door leading behind the castle is locked. This means the only way of leaving the area alive is glitching down the slope next to the castle wall on Roach's back."

In Chapter I he appears in the Outskirts along with the ghost of Leo. In Chapter IV, Geralt must be careful not to summon him while completing a quest for the Hermit. These encounters culminate at the end of the game and true to form, the witcher is faced with another dilemma, as the King has come to claim the soul of Jacques de Aldersberg.During his final conversation with Letho, Geralt recalls his forgotten memories, remembering that Eredin found him and Yennefer at the Isle of Avalon after Ciri rescued the two from the riot that took place in Rivia. The Hunt attacked Geralt and Yennefer soon after, taking the sorceress captive after laying waste to the island.Geralt had began searching for Yennefer, along the way he gathered the witchers of the Viper School and engaged the Wild Hunt in an attempt to rescue her but the Hunt far outnumbered them. So Geralt offered his soul in exchange for Yennefer's, to which Eredin agreed without hesitation.Developer CD Projekt's characterization of the King of the Wild Hunt taken from the monsterbook, which was enclosed with the Collectors Edition of the computer game The Witcher for Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic:""This powerful being leads a retinue of wraith raiders in their mad rush across the sky. The Wild Hunt, like a comet, is considered an ill omen, a harbinger of disaster and war. The King of the Wild Hunt is an unusual opponent, if only because he is from another world — a fact well known to Sapkowski's fans.""When we decided that the King of the Wild Hunt would appear in the game, we knew he had a serious part to play. From beginning to end, this nightmarish ruler appears on Geralt's path as an oppressor and portent of misery. The King of the Wild Hunt is linked to the forces of Destiny: he hovers just outside the main narrative, only appearing to remind the witcher of painful events or to provoke difficult discussions.Legends and myth about the Wild Hunt have origins in ancient Northern and Central Europe folklore, in our real world. According to myth, the Wild Hunt is a hunt or chase of spirits and other supernatural beings, all completed with hounds, horses and huntsmen.It represents an omen of danger, misfortune or catastrophe, or simply the personification of human fear. It's also cited in cinema, music and literature."

As the two made their way to get out of the ravine they were in, they came across a freshly dead body torn apart by a werewolf. A short time later they reached a cave, the only way out of the ravine. As they headed inside a scream was heard and they saw the King of the Wolves just as he was cornering another person. While still injured from earlier, Ciri killed the werewolf and saved the man. Preparing the proper sword oil is essential to making this boss fight easier. If Yaren's corpse is not fully examined, Ciri may incorrectly identify the monster as a fiend and prepare the wrong oil, making the fight more difficult. In order for the correct oil to be prepared, the chest, legs, and belly of the victim must all be examined. Basic dodge skills and attack moves are the only moves available to Ciri during this fight. This enemy has only melee attacks and will use a dash every so often to close a gap. The best strategy is to dodge in, fast attack, and dodge out before Ciri can be hit."
"587","Kiyan","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher"," School of the Cat","Kiyan was a witcher from the Cat School who was abducted by a mage called Ireneus var Steingard. This mage performed experiments on the witcher, turning him into a crazed being known as Mad Kiyan. He was possibly possessed by a demon, as referenced in the laboratory notebook.Kiyan's curriculum vitae cannot be reproduced without significant gaps in the story since the witcher didn't use a journal or diary, but there are certain notes scattered around Velen and Novigrad that help to shape a picture of Kiyan's last days as a witcher.According to these notes, the chronology began with Kiyan taking on a contract issued by Prince Adrien of the Sea Cats which consisted of killing the participants of an expedition led by professor Sigismund Gloger to find a treasure in Est Tayiar. Kiyan fulfilled the contract and then departed aboard the ship Flying Stag, despite being offered a secure post as Adrien's bodyguard.On this ship, Ireneus var Steingrad had bribed the captain to share a cabin with Kiyan so that he could kidnap the witcher. The mage took notes on Kiyan's actions and then conjured up a storm to open a portal to undisturbedly carry the witcher off to his laboratory below Novigrad. Eventually, Steingard succeeded, even though the storm was stronger than expected and wrecked the Flying Stag, killing the crew.Kiyan was then misused by Steingard and had been the subject of cruel experiments to test the physical and mental endurance of witchers. He was also interrogated and forced to reveal secrets about witcher training, and the Cat School of Witchers in particular. Steingard was pleased that Kiyan confirmed his theories: that the Cat School has elven origins. Kiyan's body survived the excruciating treatment, however, his mind was overwhelmed by the procedure after four days.Ireneus var Steingrad continued his study regardless of this fact, turning the former witcher Kiyan into a crazed and tormented shell of his former self, driven only by immense pain. This version of Kiyan, Mad Kiyan, can be found in the abandoned laboratory below Novigrad's Temple Isle, where Geralt of Rivia encounters it. Here, the former witcher can be defeated and killed, relieving Kiyan from his fate.Mad Kiyan is the crazed and possibly possessed version of the witcher Kiyan of the Cat School. The mage Ireneus var Steingard captured and performed experiments on Kiyan in his laboratory below Novigrad, tormenting both his mind and body beyond recognition. Mad Kiyan is thus an insane shell of the witcher only driven by immense pain and the urge to kill intruders.Geralt of Rivia can encounter and relieve him from his suffering in the abandoned laboratory below Novigrad. However, Mad Kiyan can prove a serious threat to Geralt since even though the mind of a human being is no longer inhabiting Mad Kiyan's body, his skills in battle remain. Mad Kiyan can use Signs consisting of a bubble of Quen, a version of Igni and Aard. His blows with a Moonblade are fast and can cause bleeding.Despite all these skills in battle, Mad Kiyan's vocabulary is restricted to muttering ""No good. No evil. Only pain.,"" ""seems you are bleeding,"" and ""This is not the end."" due to the absence of a regular human mind through the excruciating treatment by Ireneus var Steingard."

However, on his way to make the delivery, Kluhg became nervous as he passed some Temple Guards and dropped the contraband into the canal. When questioned by the guards, he claimed that the sack contained a dead cat and the guards bought it, leaving him be. Later at his hideout, Triss came by to collect her package with Geralt in toll and he relayed the story to her, leaving it to Geralt to go fish the sack out of the canal.As they finished talking though, he heard Temple Guards approaching and thought they'd been found, but the guards just happened to be passing by and were none the wiser about the group inside the home.

Known for his biting tongue, he was often rude in conversation. He was particularly rude towards Triss Merigold, addressing her only by her last name, which irritated the sorceress greatly. He does not have much use for politics, a trait common to most witchers due to their code of neutrality. He helped train Ciri in the art of combat. He was described as being at the same age as Coën. He is one of the last witchers to be trained within the walls of Kaer Morhen.Lambert appears in the main campaign of The Witcher, as well as The Price of Neutrality premium module. Despite not being fond of her, when Triss was sick and wounded after a fight with a wizard, Lambert cared for her helping to nurse her back to health. Vesemir suggests this might be because he feels guilty.In The Witcher, he is wandering around the ground floor of Kaer Morhen or busy in the courtyard for the duration of the Prologue.In ""The Price of Neutrality"", he can be found staking out the ford nearest the camp, keeping the local weed problem in check and making sure the unexpected guests do not suddenly try to enter the keep.Lambert is back in the third installment of The Witcher Series and seems to have a deep seated jealousy towards Geralt, as Geralt is an extremely famous and beloved witcher, while Lambert considers his witcher status a cruel twist of fate, and is stuck hunting relatively benign monsters for people who hate witchers.Like some of his fellow monster slayers, he dislikes the lack of choice he had in becoming a witcher; when he was a child, his father continually beat him and his mother until one day his father stumbled onto a Nekker's nest where a witcher saved his life. The witcher then invoked the law of surprise, demanding the first thing the father would see, yet not expect when returning home. Since that day, Lambert despises his lot in life but walks the path nonetheless, for he knows nothing else.Geralt had a dream in the May of 1272, in which he practised training at Kaer Morhen.

"601","Letho of Gulet","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher Assassin"," School of the Viper Kingslayers Emhyr var Emreis Vattier de Rideaux","Letho of Gulet, also known as the Kingslayer, was a witcher from the School of the Viper. His closest associates were Auckes and Serrit, also kingslayers and fellow witchers from the School of the Viper. Letho enlisted the help of Iorveth and the Scoia'tael to aid him in his plan to kill the kings of the Northern Kingdoms; to back his claim, the Viper showed Iorveth a head that belonged to Demavend III, the king of Aedirn, whom Letho had previously slain.In the forests of Angren on July 25, 1270, Letho was near death after being struck by a slyzard's tail but Geralt, a witcher from the School of the Wolf, found and saved him while chasing after the Wild Hunt to rescue Yennefer. As thanks for saving his life, Letho told Geralt where to find the Wild Hunt and, alongside his own companions, travelled with him to find the spectral riders. Eventually, the group caught up with the Wild Hunt on the Winter Solstice, by the Hanged Man's Tree in Nilfgaard. Despite their skill, the witchers couldn't defeat all the warriors and a stalemate ensued before Geralt offered himself in exchange for Yennefer.Feeling it'd be disrespectful to Geralt to just leave the sorceress somewhere, Letho and the witchers took care of her. However, she was in pain, suffering from amnesia and caused an endless source of trouble for the group, which, in the Nilfgaardian Empire, meant she was liable to get caught and killed. While the group traveled constantly to try and avoid attention, they were eventually detained and thrown in jail. However, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself later approached Letho and offered him a deal he couldn't refuse: sow chaos in the North by killing some of its rulers, lay the blame on the Lodge of Sorceresses, and the School of the Viper would be restored.King Esterad Thyssen of Kovir and Poviss was initially Letho's first target, but this never came to be as the kingslayers came into contact with Síle de Tansarville, who contracted Letho with assassinating King Demavend and helped to organise it. Thus, in 1271, Letho snuck onboard Demavend's ship out on the Pontar and, using a Northern Wind-based capsule, froze most of the ship and nearly everyone on board except a handful that were protected by Abelard's counter spell. However, this wasn't enough and all the guards fell to Letho's blade before he rounded on the king and killed him, then cut off his head for proof. Per de Tansarville's suggestion, Letho subsequently sought out Iorveth with the head in tow; yet, instead of merely using the Scoia'tael in order to lie low after the killing as Síle had envisaged, Letho also secured an alliance between the kingslayers and the Scoia'tael, whereby the latter would help Letho and his comrades to kill the kings of the North in whatever way they could.Because of the kingslayers' first attempt on King Foltest's life having failed due to Geralt being there at the time of the attack and the would-be assassin's death, Letho planned a second attempt on the Temerian monarch's life with Iorveth, while being out of Síle's or anyone else's reach. Aware of the imminent siege at La Valette Castle, Letho decided to pose as a monk guarding over the king's children - a disguise which he enacted by framing himself as a helpless monk being tortured and then killing the person who treated him to keep the secret. Foltest, after successfully taking over the castle, appeared with Geralt, now acting as a bodyguard, at which point the king asked for Geralt to give him and the children some space. With his back turned, Geralt heard the attack too late as Letho revealed himself just after he killed Foltest and fled out a window to escape with Scoia'tael assistance, leaving Geralt to be wrongly accused of regicide. Shortly after this assassination, Letho attempted to betray Iorveth by turning one of his lieutenants against him. However, the elf refused, so Letho killed his entire unit to cover his tracks and left Ciaran to be captured by Flotsam's guards.In an attempt to catch Letho, Geralt, who now knew that Letho had attempted to get rid of Iorveth, the elf to the kingslayer as a ruse to expose the latter's treachery. However, Iorveth and his Scoia'tael were attacked by the Blue Stripes, leaving Geralt and Letho to battle each other. Letho prevailed in the battle with Geralt, but once the Wolf was down, he spared him. Letho revealed that Geralt once saved his life and so they were now ""even"", before running off to kidnap Triss and force her to teleport them to Aedirn. He succeeded in capturing the sorceress, but fought and killed Cedric in the process as he tried to defend her.After arriving in Vergen, Letho abandoned Triss and regrouped with Serrit and Auckes in their hideout. Knowing that the Scoia'tael in the area would soon become aware of his betrayal, Letho and his two comrades massacred them, leaving only one survivor. Upon hearing about the upcoming summit at Loc Muinne, Letho headed there, entrusting Serrit and Auckes with assassinating Henselt.Knowing that Síle had become a liability for him, Letho sabotaged her megascope by replacing one of the crystals with a flawed one in order to dispose of her. Unless Geralt intervenes, Letho is successful and Síle explodes. Afterwards, the kingslayer waited in the center of the Temerian Quarter in Loc Muinne to talk with his former companion. Letho offered Geralt vodka, while explaining that he never had anything personal against him and proceeded to tell him about his deal with the emperor, the fate of Yennefer, and all that he knew about the Wild Hunt.If Geralt fights Letho: the two fought one last time and Geralt ultimately defeated Letho, killing him.If Geralt lets Letho go: Letho and Geralt parted ways, believing they'd never see each other again.Note: if Letho was killed at the end of the second game, what follows below isn't applicable.Having succeeded in tearing the North apart, Letho learned afterwards that it was all for naught, with Emperor Emhyr not only going back on his word to restore the School of the Viper but, as Letho was now a living witness to the emperor's plans, the witcher was a liability and assassins were sent after him. With a high price on his head and bounty hunters chasing him everywhere, Letho traveled around, not staying anywhere too long, before he dropped in at the abandoned Reardon Manor in Velen in 1272. Coincidentally, Geralt was in the area as well on unrelated business.If Geralt doesn't help him out: the two parted ways, with Letho heading off to take care of his business by himself.If Geralt helps him out: Letho and Geralt talked for a bit, with Letho explaining his ""on the run"" situation before a group of scouts arrived, no doubt sent to see if Letho was there. After the two witchers killed them off, Letho asked his former friend for help in dealing with the bounty hunters and the two set out together to track down Louis, an acquaintance of Letho's and the only one who knew where the witcher was hiding, having recommended the manor to Letho. It turned out that Louis sold him out and, not one to forgive such actions, Letho left him to die. He then had Geralt follow him to Lindenvale and told Geralt that whatever happened next, to not interfere, before throwing a bomb at a nearby barn, causing it to explode and several armed bounty hunters to run out of a nearby hut. After a short conversation between Letho and the group's leader, Arnout Vester, one of the bounty hunters shot a crossbow at the witcher and he attacked, killing off six of them before falling over, seeming dead. Letho woke up sometime later, with Geralt waiting nearby, having sensed on closer inspection that Letho had used a substance to only make it appear that he died.Letho of Gulet was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins. He was a warrior class hero."

"678","Morvran Voorhis","Human","Male",NA," Alba Division Guild of Merchants Nilfgaardian opposition","Morvran Voorhis was an Imperator of the Nilfgaardian Empire from the Voorhis family who ascended the throne sometime around the end of the 13th century. As a relative of Emhyr var Emreis through both paternal and maternal lines, his position was always secured. After his death, Jan Calveit succeeded him.Prior to ascending the throne, Morvran was a member of the Guild of Merchants, commander of the Alba Division and, thanks to his father, a prominent member of the Nilfgaardian nobility and favorite of opposition.In 1268, during a time when he was still a child according to imperial law, the original conspirators - Joachim de Wett, Ardal aep Dahy, Count d'Arvy, Berengar Leuvaarden, Count Broinne, and Stefan Skellen - planned to overthrow Emhyr and place someone who would become their puppet. Originally, Morvran's father was proposed but later they decided to put young Morvran on the Imperial throne. Before they could take any real steps, however, Leuvaarden betrayed them and they were subsequently sentenced to death.[1]Sometime after the death of Tibor Eggebracht, Morvran was appointed as the commander of an armored Alba Division and also joined Berengar Leuvaarden's Guild of Merchants. With this high ranking position and his pure-blood nationality, his status in society went up. He was also the most important general during the Third Northern War.[2]In 1272, Morvran's men were killed by the Wild Hunt while escorting Geralt and Yennefer to Vizima. During Geralt's stay in the occupied capital of Vizima, Morvran interviewed the witcher on his past while he was being shaved for his audience with Emhyr. When he had time to spare, he would either enjoy the company of Baroness Maria Louisa La Valette in her villa or go to see races near Vegelbud Residence, as he believed horses to be ""far more honest than men.""[2]As Emperor, he ordered the conviction of coadjutor of the Empire Peter Evertsen, a former imperial treasurer of the crown and chief chamberlain of the army, who died in Winneburg Castle in 1301. He was only rehabilitated in 1328 by ruling Imperator Jan Calveit.[3]Morvran Voorhis was fond of saying he could win a war without a single sword. There was much truth in that: Morvran's strategy revolved around the shrewd use of spies and saboteurs. This might not have earned him much honor, but it did earn him a great many victories. He was also known to recognize no rules in warfare. To vanquish the enemy, he was willing to make alliances with anyone, whether they be renegade witchers, war criminals, or rebellious mages. Only one thing mattered: victory.[4]He liked to keep close tabs on his enemy's activities. To this end, he would write them numerous lengthy letters; the contents were pure drivel, flowery formulations saying nothing at all, but the emissaries he sent to deliver these letters kept their eyes wide open, serving him as an extension of Secret Service. He also cultivated both a wide range of skilled spies working on the Empire's behalf, as well as special Nauzicaa Brigade officers devoted to dealing with agents foolish enough to betray the Empire.[4]"
"679","Mousesack","Human","Male","Druid Advisor to Bran, Calanthe and Crach"," Mayena Circle Skellige Circle","Advisor to Bran, Calanthe and Crach""Only ignorant fools belittle their significance.""Mousesack[1] (Polish: Myszowór), also known as Ermion, was a skilled and intelligent druid, and also a good friend and advisor to King Bran Tuirseach of Skellige, as well as Queen Calanthe of Cintra. He had a thickset and robust appearance and wore a bushy beard.Even though due to the plots of mages and King Radowit II, the Mayena Circle was destroyed, Mousesack and two older druids were invited by the king to a Witcher Tournament which was to take place on a special arena. When the tournament turned into a massacre of witchers of the Wolf School, Mousesack helped Geralt, his childhood friend, escape.[4]Mousesack was opposed to the arguments of Eltibald and Stregobor during a council of wizards in which he took part when they argued to consider the children born in the year of the Black Sun monsters.[5]Mousesack was present at the feast organized by Calanthe to celebrate Pavetta's coming of age, as part of the delegation from Skellige. He communicated secretly with Geralt by manipulating breadcrumbs on their plates to form runes. Both men felt the impending trouble of that evening — Duny's return, and Pavetta's power being unleashed — though neither knew the exact details beforehand.When everyone at the interrupted feast finally arrived at accepting Duny's claim — thanks to Geralt's and Mousesack's intervention in the heated argument — and letting Pavetta decide whether she would fulfill it, Mousesack warned Geralt of the grave danger he felt mounting in the room through breadcrumbs again. When Pavetta's power was uncontrollably unleashed by seeing Duny being injured by Rainfarn, Mousesack and Geralt used their magical powers to try and put a stop to the rapidly escalating destruction.When everything had settled again, in the early morning, Geralt and Mousesack did not draw attention to the fact that, despite the sun having risen, Duny had not yet transformed back, instead waiting to see when he'd notice it himself and amicably laughing when he did. Mousesack was ordered by the queen to heal the injured, and see to it that Pavetta would learn to control her power.In 1263, Mousesack was searching Brokilon forest for Ciri, when he came across her and Geralt, who were being attacked by mercenaries; and helped defeat the men.Later, while the trio were resting under a tree, Mousesack informed Geralt that Calanthe had cancelled Ciri's engagement to Prince Kistrin of Verden, and upon their return to Cintra with Ciri, he would also encourage her to pick her own partner. Mousesack urged Geralt to come with them to Cintra and take Ciri under his guidance, as the druid believed their fates were intertwined by the Law of Surprise. Geralt, who did not believe in destiny and thought that one is only destined to die, declined the offer.Mousesack reminisced the old prophecy, ""the Sword of Destiny has two edges"". He explained that like a two edged sword that can either serve its bearer or harm them, the destiny of Ciri and Geralt could be pure or sinister. He further explained that the bond between them could be pure, but only if Geralt connects with her as a guardian or it could manifest itself differently in a negative or destructive way if he abandoned her.Ignoring the persuations of Mousesack, Geralt got on his horse and rode away into the dark cold forest, still believing the only destiny he knew; the destiny of death.  	 		 		 		 	Mousesack eventually survived the Slaughter of Cintra and fled. In 1272, he and Geralt met again; this time at Ard Skellig, where Mousesack, known here as Ermion, managed to become a hierophant of the local circle of druids. It turned out that he did not want to let Yennefer go to the destroyed part of the forest, which she wanted to explore. He eventually allowed it only after consent from Crach an Craite, even though he was strongly upset by the sorceress because she, with the help of Geralt, stole the Mask of Ouroboros from his laboratory. His anger reached its zenith when Yen used the mask. This rendered the mask useless and also created a huge storm. He calmed down a little, though, when he learned that it was necessary to find Ciri, but he was still very angry.[6]Mousesack survived the Slaughter of Cintra, but failed to fly. Captured by Nilfgaardians, he had his identity stolen by a doppler hired by Cahir and was stabbed by this doppler, seemingly leading to his death.[7]"

She was one of the few sorceresses able to polymorph, and was thought to be ""no less than three hundred years old"" by 1267.[1]She led the Thanedd coup against the Brotherhood of Sorcerers, intending to neutralize suspected traitors allied with Nilfgaard. Later, she helped found the Lodge of Sorceresses and is considered its leader.She was one of the victims of the Witch Hunts, having been tortured and killed by Archpriest Willemer's men. Many years later, she was exonerated and canonized as Martyr Saint.Even though Geralt never met this sorceress face to face, her name appears in conversation then and again. It is also speculated that either she or Keira Metz was speaking with Triss Merigold through the latter's magic mirror at the very beginning of Chapter III.Philippa Eilhart maintained quarters in the dwarven town of Vergen, which she used to share with her ""lover"" and apprentice, a ""leashed sorceress"", Cynthia, as well as a house in Loc Muinne. Geralt first had an encounter with her at the end of Chapter I, using Síle's megascope while investigating the disappearance of Triss Merigold, if he aided Iorveth before the fight with Letho.Her nightstand in her Vergeni quarters is highlighted when the Witcher's Medallion is used, though it seems inaccessible.Philippa Eilhart was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA and had a lot of interesting weapons, skills, and skins. She was a mage class hero.Philippa Eilhart's wanted post, as it appears in NovigradPhilippa reappeared, having survived Loc Muinne, she fled to a hideout in southern Redania. In the quest Return to Crookback Bog, Geralt found a doll with obvious signs of black magic performed by the crones used to control the person this doll represents. The feathers on this doll immediately reminded Geralt of Philippa, but there was no definitive proof that the doll in fact represented her.She contacted Margarita Laux-Antille, explaining her plan to regrow her eyes by cultivating tissues on precious stones, just as Vilgefortz did, and to revive the Lodge. Then she went to Novigrad to seek help from her former lover, the sorcerer Arthur de Vleester. Having humiliated him in the past, de Vleester convinced her she'd be safer in her owl form, and then attached a dimeritium band around her ankle. Following de Vleester's execution during the witch hunts, Philippa fell into the possession of Zoltan Chivay, who affectionately named her Poppy.He later lost her to Sigismund Dijkstra, who made the mistake of removing her dimeritium band, and she returned to human form and attacked. Only Geralt's intervention put an end to her rampage. Philippa was then recruited to help stop the Wild Hunt in exchange for amnesty from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. After Margarita was rescued from Oxenfurt, she and Philippa met with Ciri to offer her equal partnership in the Lodge, to which she declined.Philippa later assisted Geralt in seeking out the Sunstone to help in their plan to lure out the Wild Hunt. While searching through the Skellige caves, Philippa criticised Geralt for having an overprotective attitude towards Ciri, stating that the Lodge were not a pack of wolves he could scare away with his sword, to which the witcher insisted that he could because they were. Once they found the Sunstone, Geralt assumed that she would take the artifact for herself, but Philippa insisted that that was not the case. She then revealed her intentions: to take Yennefer's place at Emhyr's court and become Ciri's advisor, and hoped Geralt would take Yennefer with him and leave everything to her."
"710","Phillip Strenger","Human","Male","Soldier"," Temerian Army (formerly)Nilfgaardian Empire","Phillip Strenger, commonly known as the Bloody Baron, was a self-proclaimed baron located in Velen. He took up residence in Crow's Perch after its previous owner, Vserad, fled to Fyke Isle with his family due to the threat of approaching armies.Phillip served in several wars fighting for Temeria throughout his life. During the Battle of Anchor, he took a spear in the shoulder and was tended to by Anna. Once he'd recovered, he asked her to marry him and the couple appeared to be happy and soon welcomed a baby girl, Tamara. Shortly after she was born though, Phillip was sent to Cidaris to fight in another war, this time to aid King Ethain on King Foltest's behalf. As he was seldom home, Phillip turned to drinking and soon become so dependent on it, he couldn't stop drinking even when he was home. This led to one of Tamara's first memories of him drunk and caked in mud under the stairs.Several years into the marriage, he came home one day to find Anna and their daughter gone. In their place was a note, with Anna saying she didn't love him and she'd left him for a childhood friend and the man she'd been having an affair with for the past three years, Evan, and had taken Tamara with her. Phillip then headed out to bring the girls back, but when he saw Evan, something snapped and he ended up killing the man. Upset at what Phillip did, Anna began to yell and claw at him before picking up a knife and trying to stab him. Phillip moved out of the way just in time and, not knowing what else to do, beat her. This event marked the change in their relationship to an abusive one.Many years later, during the Third Northern War, Phillip's unit was all but destroyed near the start of the invasion. Having no hope in regrouping, they began to wander north and soon other deserters and broken men joined them. By the time Phillip reached Crow's Perch, which had been abandoned by its previous lord, he had a sizable group under his command and decided to settle there, including his wife and daughter. Phillip then decided to back Nilfgaard, realizing it was impractical to resist them, and hoped to be made an official baron once they won.In 1272, he had another drunken fight with Anna, who was pregnant again, before passing out. When he came to, he couldn't remember all that'd happened but found the fetus dead in their bedroom, believed to have been a miscarriage, and Anna and Tamara gone. He proceeded to hastily bury the stillborn in a shallow grave and had all his men out searching for the women, but nobody could find a trace of them. A short time later, a peasant brought Ciri and a little girl, Gretka, to him as Ciri was injured and both were hungry. He took them in, giving Gretka a place to stay (as sending her back to a starving family wouldn't do any good) and let Ciri stay as long as she liked.Phillip and his men went on at least one hunting trip with Ciri, who impressed the group with how she killed a boar, before she extended a friendly challenge to Phillip in the form of a horse race after seeing one of his nice horses. The next morning, the two raced against each other, only to be interrupted by a basilisk. They fought against it but it got the upperhand and carried Phillip up to the top of its tower, intending to kill him. Using her powers, Ciri appeared in front of the basilisk and proceeded to kill it, stunning Phillip. However, as the Wild Hunt could sense when she used her powers, Ciri was forced to flee once more so Phillip helped her out and gave her a letter of safe conduct so she could get to Novigrad safely.Sometime later, Geralt arrived in hopes of finding information on Ciri and, recognizing who he was from what Ciri told him, Phillip talked to the witcher before offering a trade: if Geralt would help him find his missing wife and daughter, he'd tell him where Ciri went. Having not much of a choice, the witcher agreed and set out to find them.Phillip, however, hadn't told Geralt the full story of the night the women disappeared, nor the abusive relationship between him and Anna. When Geralt was visiting the Pellar, Phillip got drunk once more and the barn at Crow's Perch was struck by lightning, engulfing it in flames that nobody dared to put out as Phillip was in his mad, drunken state. When Geralt returned during all this, he had a brief fistfight with Phillip before dunking him in water and demanding he tell the full story, as the Pellar had filled the witcher in on some of the details. Phillip came clean on the abuse and where he buried the stillborn before Geralt informed him the baby had turned into a botchling and needed to be dealt with. Phillip then begged the witcher not to put his child through anymore pain.After the botchling was dealt with, Phillip refused to tell Geralt anymore on Ciri until he found Anna and Tamara."

"722","Radovid V","Human","Male",NA,NA,"Radovid V the Stern (Polish: Radowid V Srogi) was the king of Redania from the Redanian Dynasty in the last quarter of the 13th century. His reign became, along with witch hunts, one of the defining factors of the post-war period that followed the Peace of Cintra. Radovid was a polarizing figure: a brilliant strategist and a superb general by some, a paranoid madman by others. There were also many who took the middle view of his policies being harsh but justified.He inherited his titles and estates as the only son of King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore. His two older sisters were Dalimira and Milena. Even though his father died in 1267, Prince Radovid didn't succeed him immediately because he was only twelve at the time and for several years the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council under influential Duke Nitert and Count Sigismund Dijkstra, the then-spymaster of Redanian Secret Service.Radovid bore a deep aversion towards mages that stemmed from his father being secretly assassinated by an unknown elf at the behest of the sorceress advisor Philippa Eilhart,[N 3] who then pulled strings from behind his back, ruled in his name and dominated and demeaned him throughout his youth.Radovid was born in 1255 in Tretogor to the royal pair, King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore, as their third child. He grew up with two older sisters: Dalimira, informally known as Dalka, and Milena, who was known as Milka in a similar fashion. Dalka eventually dedicated her life to the priesthood after her failed engagement with King Foltest of Temeria, who instead chose to marry his own sister Adda, while Milka attended Aretuza to become a sorceress Millegarda.[2]When Prince Radovid was 9 years old he was formally engaged to Cirilla, Princess of Cintra, when she was 12. The engagement was formalized between his father and Queen Calanthe, Ciri's grandmother, but the king broke the engagement off after half a year without giving any explanation and Ciri and Radovid never even had a chance to talk to each other.[3]On the day of the outbreak of the Second Northern War with the Nilfgaardian Empire, his father had unexpectedly fallen victim to an elven assassin.[4] A fact unknown to practically anyone was that it was Philippa Eilhart, at the time fighting on Thanedd Island, who hired the elf in order to gain more direct rule. Redania fell into chaos, as usually happens in such circumstances, and Queen Hedwig was not in a state to control things.[N 3] The aristocracy started to organize itself into factions, attempting to tear some land out for each and every one of them. Several practically licked the boots of Nilfgaardian emissaries led by Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen and were ready to rule with Nilfgaardian blessing, only to be caught off guard and stopped by the famous Redanian Secret Service. There remained but a handful of those who were spared, those with important enough social status and armed might to maintain peace, like Duke Nitert.[4]Nitert was put in charge of the Regency Council appointed to save the realm from a total civil war and they managed to do so, by hanging everyone they deemed traitor in specially modified fortifications with internment camps - most infamous of which would be Drakenborg. Its members, however, overlooked their underage crown prince and none of the Northern Kingdoms' elites, not even Philippa who took it upon herself to raise him, expected him to grow into a firm monarch who would repay all humiliations he and his mother had suffered during the interregnum.A young but decisive, unrelenting King Radovid V's deed quickly earned him the epithet of ""the Stern"".[5]He began his reign by taking care of various nobles who ruled on their lands rather independently from Tretogor. He proved a capable political actor, manipulating events to the advantage of both his own position and Redania's. He utilized Redania's famed spy network to foster links with multiple potential allies, picking and choosing as he saw fit while ensuring those discarded were destroyed. In all his political actions, he attempted to embody the idea that a king should be ruthless towards his foes and generous to his friends.[6]King Radovid meeting Geralt for the first timeLooking to secure relations with Temeria, Radovid made his way to the kingdom's capital of Vizima in 1270. However, while there he eventually came into contact with Salamandra through some ""mutual acquaintances"" and thought he could make use of the criminal organization but ultimately concluded not to do so. Despite this, the witcher Geralt of Rivia happened across some of the criminals communicating via a mirror with the king, who only revealed he wasn't backing the group before closing off communications with the witcher.[7]Eventually, though, his hideout was discovered by the witcher. The two conversed for a bit, with Radovid revealing why he was in Vizima before asking the witcher's opinion on Adda the White, who he was seeing as a possible way to combine the two royal families. The two then parted ways.Back from Temeria, Radovid V began to gather his armies and erect fortresses. To counter the sorceresses' rising power, he invited the Order of the Flaming Rose to Redania and granted them lands.[8] He made several military reforms, espousing the idea that a soldier was only as good as their breastplate. He ensured that his armies were well-equipped, allowing his quartermasters as much gold as was needed to keep his infantry in solid armor. Aware that human soldiers were neither as strong as dwarves nor as dexterous as elves, identified their key advantage: their numbers. A mass of humans, led by a capable of commander, could overwhelm an individually superior force. His final military philosophy concerned the effectiveness of heavy cavalry, and he would suggest that any battlefield problem could be overcome by a gallant charge. These tactics would see him through several successful military campaigns, culminating in a subjugating nearly the entirety of the Northern Kingdoms and the defeat of the invading Nilfgaardian forces of Emhyr var Emreis' third invasion.[6]In July 1271, Radovid came to the deliberations at Loc Muinne, followed by a number of regular soldiers and knights of the Flaming Rose who were meant to ensure that peace talks remained peaceful, as well as step in if things did not go Redania's way. Shortly after arriving, the King imprisoned Phillipa Eilhart with the help of Nilfgaardian delegation. To avenge his father, he had her eyes gouged out and meant to execute her before she escaped.[8]When the Third Northern War broke out, Radovid remained the only monarch to have the strength to resist Nilfgaard. Taking advantage of this, during the winter break, he invaded a weakened Kaedwen and absorbed the Kaedwenian Army into his own. He also had Temerian partisans[9] and Kovirian mercenary companies at his disposal,[10] and considered utilizing the Crescent Moon, an influential independence movement in the Nilfgaard-conquered Nazair.[11]However, both Radovid and Emhyr had set their eyes on Novigrad, as whoever controlled the free city would not only have control over the ports, but its hefty treasury as well, therefore making victory likely for the one who gained control of it. To try and weaken the city for his taking, Radovid employed the services of Whoreson Junior, one of the ""Big Four"" of Novigrad's underground crime bosses, enticing him with money and a grand estate in Oxenfurt in return for turning on the other bosses and bringing about their downfall.His plan worked to a degree, but once it was clear that Junior had outlived his usefulness, Radovid decided to reveal his location to Geralt - who sought revenge on Whoreson Junior for unrelated reasons. However, Radovid took advantage of this and called upon Geralt for a favour; while onboard his flagship, the HMS Oxenfurt-Tretogor, Radovid asked the witcher for his help in finding and apprehending Philippa Eilhart.  	 		 		 		 			Radovid V as winner of war in Novigrad 		 	Radovid V as winner of war in NovigradIn the end, Radovid managed to defeat the invading Nilfgaardian forces, winning the Third Northern War. With this victory, Radovid absorbed all of the North - including Novigrad - into his own empire, resulting in him being known as the ""Protector of the North"".[9][6]Perhaps the most defining feature of Radovid's reign was his policy of relentless witch hunts. All over the North, groups such as mages, non-humans, herbalists and soothsayers were burned at the stake in mass numbers. Radovid seemingly lived up to an elderly age[6] and was remembered in the history as Radovid the Stern.[5] Many listed him alongside Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart as one of the key people responsible for the witch hunts.[12]  	 		 		 		 			Philippa stabbing Radovid 		 	Philippa stabbing RadovidSometime later on, while his ship was anchored in Novigrad, Radovid was approached by many others claiming to know where Philippa was, but seeing through these lies, he dealt brutal punishments to the deceivers, from having them blinded, their tongues and fingers cut off, or drowned. Geralt subsequently approached him, claiming to have found her location: St. Gregory's Bridge. After being provided proof in the form of Vizimir's ring, which Philippa had used to pass decrees in the late king's name, Radovid and his soldiers set off for the bridge at once.However, the king turned on the witcher, claiming that he irritated him, and ordered his men to kill him. The witcher was ultimately saved by the timely arrival of Temerian guerrillas, who ambushed the area and thusly caused Radovid to flee. At the last house, the monarch banged on the door to open up, but was stunned when Philippa opened the door to greet him; the sorceress then proceeded to blow powder in Radovid's face, blinding him and leaving him in agonizing pain, before she thrusted a dagger in his back, killing the king.[9]A beverage known as Redanian Herbal was called ""stern"" in honor of Radovid.[7]Radovid's Journal image"

In the process, he encountered a wounded Temerian soldier named Bastien, and the two helped each other find refuge in a nearby hut in the woods. They sat there for several days waiting for help, as they were unable to move anywhere due to their injuries. To pass the time, they'd tell stories to each other, like the time Rhosyn's commander once demanded his soldiers obey his every order, including ""shitting on command.""If Geralt decides to help Dune Vildenvert find Bastien, they encounter Bastien and Rhosyn in the hut after being led there by Bastien's dog, Hussar. Bastien refuses to abandon Rhosyn, while Dune initially refuses to take him in due to his deserter status, as the whole family could be punished if Rhosyn is ever found to be in their fold.

"728",NA,NA,NA,NA," Geralt of Rivia","Roach (Polish: Plotka) is the name that Geralt of Rivia, the witcher, gives to all of his horses. His preference is for mares.The name refers to the roach (Rutilus rutilus), a common European fresh water fish. It has nothing to do with the cockroach, and nothing directly to do with the either the French given name ""Roche"" or the character Vernon Roche. Though the English term for the fish (""roach"") does in fact share its origin with ""Roche"": both terms come from the French word for ""rock"".It's worth noting that the original name for the horse in Polish is ""Plotka"", a diminutive form of the word ""Ploc"" (meaning ""roach""). Diminutives are endearing in Polish, so a more direct translation would have been something along the lines of ""Roachy"" or ""Roachie"".Moreover, the Polish word is female gendered which corresponds with Geralt's preference for mares - it would be odd for a stallion to be called ""Plotka"". The tender tone as well as the gender of the name is lost in the translation.However, ""Plotka"" has another meaning which is ""small fry"". In the Polish version of the third game, this is brought up during Broken Flowers if Geralt beats Morvran Voorhis in a race, who will praise him by saying ""Impressive rider skills from someone for whom every horse is a small fry."" In this meaning the name becomes gender neutral, thus can be used for a stallion as well.Horse combatThe horse Geralt owned throughout the game is named Roach. There is a number of equipment available for Roach: saddles, saddlebags, and horse blinders. Saddles let Roach gallop full speed longer, saddlebags increases Geralt's inventory limit, and the blinders decreases the rate that Roach's fear level rises.In a contrast to the previous games, trophies gained from contracted monsters appear tied to Roach's saddle instead of on Geralt's person. If Geralt visits Emhyr after he finds Ciri, and does not accept the coin offered, when he leaves he is granted a black Pure Bred Nilfgaardian thoroughbred stallion.

Unlike her colleagues, Sheala was not known to interfere in politics and instead dedicating her days to research. She even resigned her seat with the Council of Wizards because it interfered with her work. Sheala liked to dress in a strict, black velvet gown trimmed with pearls and often wrapped a silver fox boa around her neck. Queen Zuleyka of Kovir once sought her magical assistance in getting her son away from the evil influences of the ""bad crowd"" he had fallen in with. Sheala was also known as the Koviri Loner.Sheala was invited to the meeting of sorceresses in Montecalvo's castle by Philippa Eilhart. At first Sheala was reluctant to join, since her scholarly work kept her occupied, but she changed her opinion later on.She was also the one who named their secret organization ""The Lodge.""After the king of Kovir, Esterad Thyssen, experienced a bad dream, he began seeking the aid of some kind of astronomer or fortune teller, when his wife, Zuleyka, mentioned that Sheala happened to be in Lan Exeter. The king refused to seek her help.[2]In fact, Queen Zuleyka was Sheala's informant and it was the sorceress who had influenced the king's dreams. The two women had made a deal in which the queen was to provide personal information regarding the king's thoughts on the secret loan that Redania obtained from Kovir, in exchange for Sheala's magical aid in helping Prince Tankred to distance himself from the company he had been keeping, as well as to stop ""chasing skirts"" until he was introduced to Ciri of Cintra. It was also revealed that Sheala was in league with Philippa Eilhart.[2]Sheala and Philippa were planning to introduce Ciri to Prince Tankred, so that she could become his lover and give him a child. The child was to ensure the future and status of the Lodge. After the birth, Ciri was to become the Lodge's new member. They needed to invent a new surname for Ciri, so that their plan could work. Sheala offered Ciri to take hers, in that case she would be known as ""Cirila de Tancarville"", but she refused, preferring to be called ""Cirilla of Vengerberg.""When the Lodge decided whether or not to allow Ciri meet Geralt one last time, Sheala voted against it to teach Ciri discipline.Síle appears in The Witcher 2.

The witcher discovers Síle knows him and notices the tension between the two sorceresses. They agree on hunting the beast together. In the meantime, the sorceress hires Zoltan Chivay to polish some diamonds she could use to build herself a megascope, an apparatus performing many complicated magical operations and enabling her to communicate with other sorceresses.When it comes to fighting the beast, Síle lures the kayran to the shore and help Geralt slaying it. She then harvests some rare ingredients from the corpse. As Philippa later claims, they were needed to cure Henselt's impotence and thus make the king trust a sorceress and allowing Síle to his court.It is no wonder then that after leaving Flotsam she is found by the king's side and attends the negotiations between prince Stennis and the Dragonslayer. When the mist of Sabrina's curse descends, de Tansarville defends the Kaedweni king and manages to escape with him and Dethmold back into their camp.During the quest ""Enter the Dragon"", she attempts to teleport away from Loc Muinne, unaware that her megascope has been sabotaged by Letho. Geralt can choose to remove the flawed diamond to save her life, or leave it alone causing her to be torn to pieces.If Geralt saved her life in The Witcher 2, Síle appears in the prison at Oxenfurt along with Margarita Laux-Antille.

However, he was an exceptionally clever man, having studied at Oxenfurt Academy, and was said to be very influential in Redania.[4] While he was referred to as a count in public, this was merely a cover that King Vizimir II ordered him to use so nobody would know that Dijkstra was a mere commoner.[5]As a minor spy in the Secret Service's Novigrad cell, Sigismund somehow managed to obtain documents proving Michael de Noailles' incompetence and the tragic situation of the state infiltrated by foreign intelligences. In 1248 he wrote a letter to King Vizimir II, adressed For Your Royal Eyes Only. The King, enraged, ordered to imprison Count de Noailles and elevated Dijkstra to the position of the Royal Security Assignee. In a few years Dijkstra managed to overhaul the Service's structures, replacing moles with faithful men and expanding the area of operations from Kovir to Nilfgaardian Empire. He moved his quarters to Oxenfurt, to the rented University's rooms he called ""Faculty of Most Contemporary History"". Around this period he romanced Philippa Eilhart, who would often cooperate with the spymaster since then.[6]The biggest challenge Dijkstra faced was the Nilfgaardian Military Intelligence. The web collaborators among state officials and aristocracy, disposing of enormous sums of money and hard to infiltrate was barely touched by his agents prior to the Northern War I. And then, just after reports from Cintra ceased to reach Oxenfurt quarters, the Nilfgaardian agents unleashed hell in Redania. Military warehouses were burned, cavalry horses were poisoned, many commanders were found dead with knives in throats. Sigismund Dijkstra, the masterspy, had to learn a hard lesson in humility from his opponent, Vattier de Rideaux.The startle did not last long. Shortly after the initial shock, the Service's agents in all the Realms started to hit on persons for long suspected of collaboration with the Empire. The traitors' blood flowed like rivers, though mistakes were made and certain innocents, especially nonhumans, were killed as well. The few Nilfgaardian informants who managed to avoid Drakenborg fled to Kovir and Hengfors, but even there the knife and the garrote awaited them.Before Dijkstra could trace the traitors among nobles however, the war ended and terms of the truce required to end the bloodshed. Unable to eliminate the core of imperial spy web in Redania, he was back at the starting point.[6]Some time after the war, he recruited Dandelion as his informant and asked Yennefer to protect the bard when he was captured by Rience in a town near Bleobheris. The sorceress saved Dandelion and ordered him to hide under Dijkstra's wing. Later, Sigismund managed to calm the tension when Geralt and Olsen killed Temerian agents who, while they were legit agents, had at the time been acting on their own in pursuit of Geralt and Ciri to try and claim Rience's reward for the pair. Together with Philippa, the spymaster asked Dandelion about Geralt's current whereabouts; Dijkstra was surprised when Philippa mentioned Ciri as well, perceiving it as a hasty move.[4]In 1267 he learned that traitors were active again and sent word via a royal messenger, Aplegatt, to inform King Demavend III of Aedirn to not go through with a staged attack as now Nilfgaard knew about their plans. However, he learned too late this message was never delivered as the messenger had been killed in an isolated incident.Later that year, in late June, he joined Philippa on Thanedd Isle as part of their plan to take out the Nilfgaardian supporters before they could put their own coup in action. At the banquet he talked for some time with Geralt before heading off. The next day, in the early hours just before dawn, he began to help Keira Metz round up the Nilfgaardian supporters with the assistance of his soldiers. As they were arresting Artaud Terranova, Geralt stumbled upon them and Dijkstra had the witcher detained before discussing with the mages on what to do before taking Geralt to Philippa to decide. As he felt Geralt wouldn't cause them too much trouble, Dijkstra didn't bind the witcher, which he would regret later.On the way, Dijkstra, in his ever sarcastic demeanor, informed Geralt what was going on and asked where Yennefer was. Geralt, not truly understanding the gravity of the situation, told him last he checked she was sound asleep in bed, pissing the spymaster off as the plan had been only for Nilfgaardian supporters to go to bed while the rest made their move (not realizing Yennefer, like many others, had actually remained neutral). After talking with Philippa, she gave Dijkstra part of their deal: a list that'd been on Vilgefortz that had names of Redanians who'd sold out to Nilfgaard. Satisfied with the list, Dijkstra then had Geralt follow him through the towers, intending to head to Loxia as the spymaster knew, despite rumors, Ciri, the sole heir and princess of Cintra, was alive and in the school, but the rectoress would not hand Ciri over to anyone except Geralt.When it became clear to Geralt that the spymaster planned to use Ciri as a political tool, intending to send her to Redania's capital, Tretogor, the witcher punched the spymaster and Dijkstra, along with the few soldiers he had with him, tried to fight the witcher but were all knocked out. Dijkstra then threatened to get his soldiers from the ship but Geralt, intent on finding Yennefer and Ciri without distractions, summarily broke one of the spymaster's ankles, causing the man to howl and faint from the pain.It was later revealed that the previous night, King Vizimir had been assassinated and, with the start of the Second Northern War, the country was ruled by a Regency Council headed by Dijkstra and Philippa (even though technically Queen Hedwig was supposed to be the ruler).[5] Incensed by the failed coup on Thanedd and how quickly Nilfgaard was taking over other kingdoms, Dijkstra began to hang people left and right in Redania, though he wasn't able to walk for two weeks, and even then required help from Philippa to do so.[7]A few weeks later he was informed by one of his men that Geralt was recovering in Brokilon. However, Dijkstra ordered them to leave the witcher alone, though that wasn't to say he forgave the witcher for breaking his ankle, he just didn't have the time and was professional enough to not use his own men to settle a private matter. He then sent out correspondence to Philippa, still intent on finding information that Yennefer had sided with Nilfgaard. He was later visited by the Nilfgaardian ambassador, Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, and the two conversed about politics before turning to what they both really wanted: Dijkstra believed Nilfgaard was hiding Vilgefortz and Yennefer and wanted them, while Shilard believed Redania had Cahir, a Nilfgaardian knight that was wanted for treason. However, neither actually had the people in question and Shilard left. Dijkstra then sent another letter to Philippa, piecing together that the earlier news they heard about Nilfgaard having Ciri was false, or rather, a fake Ciri, meaning the real one was still out there somewhere. To confirm these suspicions, he later received important information from a prisoner that was about to be hanged, confirming that it was a fake Ciri.Still intending to find Vilgefortz, as now Dijkstra and Philippa believed it was likely Ciri was with the rogue sorcerer, the spymaster put Redania's Secret Service to use and found two of Vilgefortz's hangouts, but no sorcerer or Ciri. However, they did find evidence that Vilgefortz had been experimenting on pregnant women, killing them in the process.[7]Later, in late October, he made his way to Lan Exeter, the winter capital of Kovir and Poviss, to try and ask for a loan of a million bizants to raise an army in time for spring, when Nilfgaard would start up its assault on the North once more. However, Kovir's king, Esterad Thyssen, refused on the grounds of the kingdom's neutrality and an old agreement that meant he couldn't back Nilfgaard's enemies. Despite this, the king's wife, Zuleyka, gave him advice that showed him a loophole and was thus able to supply the spymaster indirectly. Dijkstra, having struck up an unlikely friendship with Esterad, ended up staying a little bit longer and the two had philosophical debates. On their last conversation before Dijkstra left, Esterad warned the spymaster to stop all the bloodshed in Redania, as it'd bring nothing but assassins after him sooner or later.Following the meeting with Esterad, Sigismund had growing suspicion towards Eilhart and her close circle of sorceresses at Montecalvo[1] During the autumn and winter, apart from preparations to raise troops and in secret from Philippa, Dijkstra and his personal assistant Ori Reuven aided Jacques de Aldersberg in his mission to reform Order of the White Rose into Order of the Flaming Rose with aim to ballance the rising position of sorceresses and aid the forces fighting Nilfgaard with a strong knightly order. Dijkstra was aware of the dangers that hosting the Order in Redania might bring, thus ensuring that its headquarters would lie south to the Pontar, in Temeria.[8] It was also apparently during this period when he, under alias of Sigi Reuven, co-founded the Syndicate, an underground alliance of criminal bosses and church officials that was to end the period of instability in Novigrad streets. Taking information out of drunken Walter Veritas, he was able to capture and eliminate the Nilfgaardian agent Doadrick Leumaerts and later recruited Walter to the Syndicate.[9]In January 1268 Dijkstra received a letter from Geralt, informing him that Vilgefortz's hideout was located in Stygga Castle, Ebbing. Unable to operate that far south of the Yaruga, he traded this information to Vattier de Rideaux in exchange for details on Vizimir's assasination learned by Nilfgaardian Intelligence.[10]As the de factor ruler of Redania, Queen Hedwig, was still indisposed, Dijkstra joined the other kingdoms' rulers in Cintra to discuss the peace terms in April 1268. However, due to being a non-royal, many of the rulers scoffed at him being there and the Hierarch, Cyrus Engelkind Hemmelfart, even noted to himself that they must do away with the spy. After peace was officially declared, a celebration was held in Novigrad and the spy informed Philippa that he'd learned the half-elf that assassinated Vizimir hadn't been acting alone. Sometime later, he walked through Tretogor Castle one last time, saying goodbye to his personal assistant, Ori Reuven, noting that he'd said one word too many to one person too many but, having been tipped off by Vattier de Rideaux and Emhyr var Emreis, knew assassins were coming for him, and fled the country.He later appeared in Elskerdeg Pass and met Isengrim Faoiltiarna and Boreas Mun, two fugitives on the run for their own reasons. An unlikely party, the three agreed to travel east together, to Zerrikania or Hakland, with Dijkstra taking on the name Sigi Reuven once again.[10]Dijkstra in NovigradSometime later Dijkstra, still using the alias Sigi Reuven, returned to the Northern Kingdoms. He arrived in Novigrad where he bought a bathhouse[2] and completed the Syndicate's code of conduct.[3] In 1272 he and three other most influential gang leaders were known as the Big Four.After the outbreak of the Third Northern War, Dijkstra, not approving of how Radovid was ""destroying"" everything his father, Vizimir II, had built up, began to work with the Temerian loyalists Vernon Roche, Ves, and Thaler, in their plan to assassinate King Radovid V and make Temeria a vassal state to Nilfgaard while allowing the rest of the North to be swallowed up by the empire.[2]If Geralt doesn't complete Reason of State quest (default): The assassination however was never carried out, thus allowing King Radovid to win the war against Nilfgaard and gather again the Northern Kingdoms under the silver eagle blazon. Dijkstra's fate remained unknown.If Geralt completes Reason of State quest: The assassination was successful but, having despised surrendering Redania in favor of Temeria's semi-independence, the former head spy turned on the Temerians and planned to kill them, as he knew they wouldn't go along with his plans.Around late 1270s, Dijkstra was known as King Sigismund. He refused attending the wedding of Geralt and Yennefer but sent Sir Matholm as his royal envoy.[11]As seen in E3 DemoIn an E3 demo of The Witcher 3, he was shown to be back in the Northern Kingdoms, having contracted Geralt to hunt down a griffin in Novigrad. In exchange, he would find the whereabouts of an ashen-haired lass. After Geralt returned successfully with the griffin's head, Dijkstra reveals that Ciri was spotted in Velen in the company of a childlike creature named Johnny. He then asked Geralt if the girl is who he thought she was, but the witcher simply doesn't answer and thanks him for the information as he departs his company.The E3 quest is absent in the full-release version of The Witcher 3.In The Witcher 3, Geralt meets the spymaster once more. After his return in the Northern Kingdoms, Dijkstra moved to Novigrad where he apparently approached the criminal underworld of the city, becoming one of the most noted four criminal lords."

As the price was too good to pass up, Sigo bought it and went exploring in his new home. However, while he checked out the tower, the tower's Defensive Regulatory Magicon kicked in: a magical defensive mechanism that, when it detected an intruder (that is, not Gottfried), it proceeded to lock down all access and killed off everyone with various mechanisms. Sigo became trapped in one of the rooms and with Gottfried's Omni-opening Grimoire in another location, was unable to get out to disable the DRM.If Geralt comes along and helps: Thankfully Geralt came in to investigate the tower, though Sigo wondered why the witcher was in Kovir only for Geralt to reveal that the tower had teleported to Skellige. Realizing it was another function of the DRM, Sigo was able to get Geralt to retrieve the grimoire and disable the DRM. He then thanked the witcher and told him if he ever visited Kovir he should drop by to see him before teleporting Geralt back to Urialla Harbor and then teleported the tower back to Kovir."

He then took to watching over Ciri as she slept for almost a day while the elf went searching for a boat.Once Ciri woke up, he informed her about the elf and how much time had passed before Astrid interrupted their conversation and, with Ciri desperate to get to the location the elf gave her, was sent off to ready a couple horses while Astrid took Ciri to the sauna to help her heal.After Ciri finished up at the sauna and the two got ready to ride out, the Wild Hunt attacked the village and the two helped fight before making a run for the horses. Even though the villagers were in immediate danger, Skjall insisted on getting Ciri to the location to make sure she was safe before returning to the village. However, when he got Ciri to the elf, who was waiting with a boat, he watched as they appeared to argue before the elf used a spell to knock her out and get her on the boat. Seeing this, Skjall raced down to get to them but was knocked down from behind by the Wild Hunt as the boat left shore. Some time later, Skjall woke up long enough to see Uma before passing out once more.When Geralt and Yennefer trace Ciri's steps to Lofoten, they learn that the elders, believing Skjall had fled the battle due to cowardliness, had branded him as Craven.

"770","Bernard Ducat","Human","Male","Spymaster When in cover: Fence (The Witcher) Cobbler (The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt)"," King Foltest of Temeria","Bernard Ducat, better known as Thaler, was a master spy and the former head of Temerian Intelligence during the 1270s.Sometime prior to 1270, Thaler was already the head of Temerian Intelligence, where he helped with various spy activities as well as more unusual tasks, such as sending some of his men out to hunt down catoblepas for their meat, as it was Adda the White's favorite dish.During this time a young Shani happened to be in Vizima and, taking a liking to her, Thaler asked her out, but hid who he really was. However, one night while they wandered the city, Shani noticed two spies following them and eventually the inept men accidentally revealed that Thaler was, in fact, the head of Temerian Intelligence, ending their short relationship.Eventually in 1270, Thaler began to pose as a fence in the city to gather intel and was visited by Coleman, who sold him some witcher equipment he'd found. Thaler eventually sold this off to the guards, not realizing it'd soon lead to him crossing paths with the witcher Geralt, who was also looking for the owner of the sword. During this time, King Foltest also left the city for a bit and personally put Thaler in charge while he was away.Shortly after, Geralt visited and, after Thaler revealed what he knew about Berengar, the two parted ways only to meet up again later during an important reception for high class society. However, this time Thaler was now using his real identity, Bernard, and revealed to Geralt who he really was. He eventually asked a favor for a favor and had Geralt retrieve a mysterious letter, not revealing he believed someone was forging documents as Foltest. With the newest letter in hand though he was finally able to confirm it, as the letter was supposedly from Foltest stripping Thaler of his position as chief but was missing the king's signature.As the party winded down, Thaler went outside but soon got into an argument with Roderick de Wett, and while the count remarked Thaler was just mad about being fired, Thaler noted de Wett knew more than he was letting on.If Geralt defends Thaler: Thanks to the witcher stepping in, Thaler was saved from being killed by de Wett and his men. He then asked Geralt to meet him back in the inn to talk and Thaler revealed all the evidence he'd gathered on the forged documents.If Geralt kills him or walks away: With no one else to protect him and outnumbered, Thaler was quickly killed. Game continuation: Note that this is one of the few times in the games where your choice has no effect and Thaler will appear alive in the third game, even if killed here and you imported saves all the way through.After Nilfgaard invaded Temeria in late 1271, they quickly dismantled the kingdom's secret service and Thaler barely escaped with his life. Not knowing what else to do, he proceeded to drink away his sorrows until his ""liver screamed bloody murder"" then decided he had to do something about the situation. Shortly thereafter he got into contact with Vernon Roche and Sigismund Dijkstra and the three decided something extremely drastic had to be done: King Radovid V of Redania had to die.Using his experience as Temeria's former spymaster, he began to recruit new spies and took on the role of a traveling cobbler by the name of Clogs, noting that cobblers didn't attract any attention while still being able to see and hear all the people around them while they worked.If Geralt takes part in A Deadly Plot: While relatively safe from being harassed by soldiers, Thaler found himself instead attacked by a group of rock trolls who wanted shoes of their own.

"771","The Ghost in the Tree",NA,"Female",NA,NA,"The Ghost in the Tree is a character in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It is located beneath the Ancient Oak in a forested area south of Downwarren.A lot of mystery surrounds the spirit but one thing appears to be certain: she wasn't human and the Crones killed her (or rather, destroyed her body) then captured her spirit and imprisoned it in the tree. The full truth of why though is never revealed.Many locals appear to believe the book She Who Knows, where the spirit is described as someone who arrived from far away and created three daughters and watched over the land. Locals would bring sacrifices like grain and men to her every Spring, but she started to slip more and more into madness to the point the land and its people were being destroyed. To save the area, the daughters killed their mother and imprisoned her immortal spirit.However, as many locals worship the Crones, and considering the long amount of time that's passed since the Lady of the Wood walked the land, the book may not be entirely truthful."

"788","Triss Merigold","Human","Female","Advisor Mage"," King Foltest of Temeria Lodge of Sorceresses Temerian Royal Council","Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the 13th century. Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the Fearless. A member of King Foltest's royal council along with Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but also unhappily in love with the latter.[2] Triss took care of Ciri at Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister to her. It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.Not much is known about Triss' upbringing. Not even a precise time of her birth, which is a subject to some degree of confusion - see below. What is known is the fact, that she was born and lived as a child in Maribor. Sometime during her childhood, she had a conduit moment and was noticed by sorcerers. Thus, she found her way to Aretuza. Here, she became a sorceress on her own, specializing in making of magical potions, mainly healing ones. This was rather amusing twist of fate as she herself was alergic to magical potions and could only tolerate non magical ones.After the graduation, she became a very well known and respected sorceress taking her assignment as a advisor to the throne of Temeria.During her studies, she befriended a fellow sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg. During 1249, which is a time when a story ""The Last Wish"" takes place, the two of them were already close friends and colleagues.Some time later, Triss found out about her friend's on and off relations with Geralt of Rivia. Curious about the nature of that relationship, she used a magic and seduced the witcher, resulting in them spending time together in Kaer Morhen as lovers. During those time, Triss became very good friend with some of the other witchers, Vesemir and Eskel. The former liked her so much that he started to call her ""little daughter"". Since then, she was always welcome in the witcher's keep.After some time however, the spell faded and Geralt simply ended the relationship. This proved to be a very difficult for Triss as she fell in deep love with Geralt. Despite that, the two of them remained very good friends in years to come and even though Triss was still unhappily in love with him, he did not wish to start anew.When the Great War with Nilfgaard started and the Kingdom of Cintra was destroyed, sorcerers under the leadership of Vilgefortz of Roggeveen decided to stand with the North and manned an old Elven ruin on Sodden Hill. Here, they wanted to stop the invading forces. Triss was among those who volunteered. The battle was brutal and the mages stood against incredibly strong forces but in the end, they managed to defeat the invaders. The cost of victory was high, though, as 13 mages died. As a matter of fact, it was first believed that the number of dead was 14 - the last one being Triss. She was very seriously wounded, not only sustaining a deep cut on her chest, but also having all of her hair burnt off. With Yennefer, the only mage that would have still recognised her, blinded during the battle, she was counted amongst the dead.When Geralt rode near Sodden some time later, he saw the memory stone erected in remembrance of those who gave their lives to protect the North. Triss was among them, which saddened Geralt very deeply. When it was later discovered that Triss had indeed managed to survive the battle, she became known as ""the fourteenth of the hill"".Not long after the battle, Triss received a message from Geralt, asking her to come to Kaer Morhen, to help him with his Child of Surprise - Ciri. Ciri was trained by the witchers, yet she started to show some strong magical abilities that were beyond what was conventional for witchers. Thus, Triss accepted and went there, but she was reluctant to be near Geralt again as her feelings for him had not faded. During her stay, she constantly struggled with the way she felt but she eventually managed to clear her mind and do her job. Ciri, as she discovered, was a young lady with sad history and the two of them took liking to each other instantly. Their bond was so strong that Ciri started to consider Triss her older sister and vice versa. Some disquiet between Triss and the witchers surfaced when Triss discovered that the witchers want to submit Ciri to special potions. While not as invasive as the Trial of the Grasses, the potions would still cause harm to her body and most likely leave her barren. She begged them not to give her those, and eventually they agreed.The other problem was that Ciri slowly became a woman and, being only girl in the keep, she had nobody to ask about specifics that comes with that. When Triss discovered that Ciri had no idea about her own cycles and that the witchers were unaware of them as well, she was furious. Since then, whenever Ciri came in dress, the training would stop until she change to the training attire.More problematic, however, was her increasingly strong proficiency with magic. Witchers told Triss, that since Ciri came to the keep, she had 3 incidents where she spoke a different voice in unrecognizable language and had trance - like state. In the last one, she also foretold the death of Geralt. They said that the first time it happened was after Ciri accidently drunk a potion, the same potion, that now stood before Triss. When Ciri came, Triss tricked her into drinking said potion to the shock of all the witchers. She told them however, that she knows what she is doing. Ciri started to dance and not long after fell into a trance. Triss teleptaically connected with her and tried to find out what is the problem. While connected to the young girl, she felt a strong presence inside her. Triss used all her power and identification spells but it all proved futile. This battle of wills proved very draining and Triss passed out.Later, she woke in her bed with Geralt next to her. He told her that she was out for six hours and ensured her that Ciri is alright and sleeps in her room. The sorceress told Geralt that whatever bounds with Ciri is way too powerfull for her and that he should contact Yennefer, who is more knowledgable about such things. Geralt was reluctant, considering their past, but Triss insisted it would be the best for the girl. After Geralt agreed, Triss told him that when spring comes, they should take Ciri to the Temple of Melitele. The witcher agreed and then spent the night with the old friend, taking care of her.Next few months, Triss spent every day with Ciri and tought her various topics, including the Elder Speech. But she also showed her a delicacy of make-up. As the spring neared the witchers were slowly preparing to go on the path once again and they wanted to know all the relevant news from the continent so to decide where to go.Triss told them everything she knew and they eventually talked about the possibility of second war with Nilfgaard. This resulted in a heated debate about witchers and their neutrality.That night, they decided that with the morning light, they will go to the temple.Triss, along with Geralt and Ciri went on the way. Not long after, Triss became ill, having very strong stomach ache. Her illness was worse and worse to such a state, that she was not able to hold herself in the saddle. Thus Geralt had to carry her on his horse. But even with that, they were slow and had to stop for the sorceress to relieve herself.Eventually they arrived to a village. This however proved not a good sign, because the settlement was attacket by elven commandos of Scoia'tael. Triss was laid down with the other wounded while Geralt went to find out what are their options. He learned about the attack and the planned retaliation. However he knew, they have noone, who could cure Triss. What was worse, the men started to think, that Triss may have some infection that could spread. Even though Geralt told them, that mages cannot have an infection due to their immunity, and that it had to be a case of food poisoning, they did not want her there.Thus the trio was forced to go on. Fortunately, Geralt learned about a convoy that went the same way as they need to so they rode to them. There they discovered that in the convoy was an old friend, dwarf Yarpen Zigrin. Geralt persuaded Yarpen and a knight in charge of the convoy to allow the trio to join them. Triss was laid to one of the vagons but her state was still very severe. She was no longer able to relieve herself on her own and Geralt had to carry her into the woods. Other dwars watched this with a surprise. They were not sure if they would do the same for their own wives. When Ciri told them, that Triss and Geralt were not couple but friends, they could not believed it.They continued of the way and Triss started to feel better. But she was still very weak thus Geralt and Ciri had to help her with bathing and clothing. As a matter of fact, despite her state, Triss rather enjoyed Geralt holding her so tightly and caring for her.Sometime later the convoy was approached by soldiers from Kaedwen. Those soldiers warned the men that Scoia'tael are near so they should continue very carefully. Not long after that, the elves indeed attacked the convoy. Triss was thrown out of the vagon and had nasty wound on her head. The attack was swift but the defenders managed to repel it. By that time, Triss was well enough, to be able to take care of the wounded and help them with her magic.The rest of the journey was without any incident and they succesfully arrived in the temple. Triss then went on her own giving her farewells to both Ciri and Geralt.Triss is a major character in The Witcher computer game. She is one of the first people Geralt meets after being found unconscious in the woods by his fellow witchers.She is also the one to nurse Geralt back to health after his first battle with Azar Javed in the Swamp. Once Geralt regains consciousness, he finds himself in the bedroom of her luxurious Trade Quarter home, and he sees her talking presumably to another sorceress. She diligently ""checks him for internal injuries"".For the main article, see The Witcher romance.PrologueDuring the prologue, after dealing with the Salamandra invasion of Kaer Morhen, Triss is gravely wounded and needs a special potion which Geralt must brew to help her recover. If not rushed during the dialogue, after drinking the potion, she offers Geralt his first sexual encounter of the game.Chapter IIIIf it was Triss and not Shani who was chosen to take care of Alvin the second romance option becomes available if she is given a ruby ring, and in regards to Alvin, Geralt must be strict at least once.Triss plays a major role throughout the story. She first appears in the prologue as Geralt's lover; her feelings for him have evidently remained unchanged. Triss assists Geralt and Foltest in taking La Valette castle. She gets separated from them when a dragon attacks Foltest's forces. After Geralt is imprisoned for Foltest's murder, she meets up with him and Vernon Roche before they set sail for Flotsam, having lost her position as advisor after Foltest's death. In Flotsam, she meets with fellow Lodge member, Síle de Tansarville, and becomes suspicious of her presence. She helps Geralt prepare to fight a kayran by introducing him to Cedric, finding the Kayran's lair, and helping him create a potion to allow Geralt to resist the beast's poison. After Geralt meets Letho, Triss and Cedric break into Síle's room and Triss uses the megascope to try to gain more information on Síle (by speaking either to Dethmold or Philippa). Shortly after, Letho abducts Triss and forces her to teleport them to Vergen.In Vergen, Triss gets away from Letho and tries to make contact with Philippa. She finds Philippa's room, but comes upon Philippa's apprentice, Cynthia, there instead. Cynthia, a Nilfgaardian spy, captures Triss using Artefact compression, and smuggles Triss across the mist of wraiths, where Triss eventually makes it into the hands of Nilfgaard's ambassador, Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. Before Geralt can rescue her, Shilard takes his ship to Loc Muinne.In Loc Muinne, he commissioned the help of Assire var Anahid to decompress Triss. Triss is restrained and interrogated for more information of the Lodge. If Geralt chooses not to save her, in favor of helping Roche or Iorveth, a massacre erupts in Loc Muinne, with opposing forces fighting not only one another, but also mages after Nilfgaard revealed the Lodge's involvement with the Northern regicides. In the chaos, Letho saves Triss from the Nilfgaardian camp, and takes her to the now abandoned Temerian camp and protects her until Geralt arrives after fighting the dragon. Once Geralt reaches the camp, Triss steps away, while the two witchers talk.If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss, he breaks into the Nifgaard camp and eventually finds her restrained and asks her about the Lodge and their influence behind the Demavend and Foltest's murders. When Geralt and Triss go to the amphitheater, Triss reveals Síle's role in the assassinations, allowing Carduin to reject Síle from joining the reformed Conclave of Mages. Triss and Geralt are separated again when Geralt goes to fight the dragon, and they meet up shortly afterwards, where Triss tells Geralt that Letho is waiting for him. On their way to Letho, Triss explains that mages helped prevent further bloodshed in the city. Regardless whether Geralt rescued her or not, after Geralt confronts Letho, he leaves Loc Muinne with Triss (and maybe with Roche or Iorveth).For the main article, see The Witcher 2 romance.Triss is the default romance option - the game begins with her and Geralt already in a relationship. One of three opening scenes of Geralt's story during the prologue shows him getting up as Triss lies naked beside him as a messenger soldier enters their tent to summon the witcher to the King Foltest's side.The first real opportunity arises near the end of Chapter I during the quest The Rose of Remembrance. When given the option to go to the elven baths, Geralt can choose to take the sorceress along with him. After a battle partway through the quest, the ground under their feet collapses, sending the two plummeting into ancient elven baths. Noting that an immediate escape is impossible, the two can take advantage of their location. Selecting the correct conversation options will initiate a cutscene, in which Triss completely takes off her clothes with magic and jumps into the water. Our Witcher soon joins her in the bath. After the lovers enjoyed one another well enough, Triss comments this short time of bliss in such a manner: ""We should take walks more often. For a while there, I forgot all about Flotsam, the Scoia'tael, the kingslayer, the whole world really..."".Since March 31, 2015, Triss Merigold is a new playable character in the MOBA ""The Witcher Battle Arena"".Triss returns in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as the leader of the mage underground due to the witch hunt begun by Radovid V. Her appearance did not change much but interactions with Yennefer prove quite interesting. There is also a free DLC which gives Triss an alternative outfit.After the events at Loc Muinne Triss and Geralt (who had now regained his memory) separated. Triss decided to go to Novigrad, which many mages believed to be a safe haven, and set up a shop in the city center. The Eternal Fire religion in the city, however, declared all mages to be witches and traitors and began arresting and murdering them.Triss was forced to seek the protection of The King of Beggars to whom she paid 80% of her earnings whilst attempting to gain enough money to escape the city with her fellow mages. Geralt, upon arriving at the city, found Triss with the King of Beggars and assisted her ridding a rat infested mill. The Mill owner, however, sold her out to the witch hunters, and if not for the efforts of Geralt, Triss would have been captured.Triss accompanies Sigismund Dijkstra to Margrave Henckel's house to meet with Geralt, who was searching for Dijkstra's lost treasure; Triss agreed to stick her neck out in exchange for Dijkstra's financial aid in smuggling the mages out of Novigrad. After Geralt told Dijkstra that Caleb Menge, the leader of the witch hunters, had his treasure, and after the ex-spy had left, the witcher informed Triss that Menge had Dandelion imprisoned. To find Ciri, Triss then helped Geralt discover the location of Dandelion by allowing herself to be taken to the witch hunters and tortured whilst Geralt gained the information. Ultimately she kills her torturers before killing Menge.If Geralt assists Triss in spiriting all the mages under her wing to Kovir, it results in the witch hunters targeting nonhumans. Helping Triss ensures she goes to Kaer Morhen to fight the Wild Hunt. Before the Hunt's attack, she is happily reunited with Ciri, whom she provides with a magical stone that will call down a fireball that would strike down all her attackers except herself.Following the battle, Triss goes with Yennefer and Avallac'h to Novigrad to try and reunite the Lodge of Sorceresses, taking up residence at the Rosemary and Thyme, an establishment owned by Dandelion. Unfortunately, they had not much luck, as Ida Emean outright refused and Francesca Findabair wouldn't budge from her realm with a war raging.When Geralt later arrived, Triss berates him for putting Ciri in danger by taking her to the Sabbath to face Imlerith. Afterwards, she informed him that the only Lodge member she could locate was Philippa Eilhart, who was tricked into her owl form by Arthur de Vleester, who put a dimeritium band on her leg afterwards. Worse yet, Philippa came into the possession of Zoltan Chivay, who lost her in a card game. Luckily, Triss found a feather. Using hydromancy at the fountain behind the Passiflora and divined that Philippa was in the possession of Sigismund Dijkstra. They rush to his bathhouse, where Philippa, having regained human form after Dijkstra foolishly removed her dimeritium band, was wreaking havoc. After Geralt managed to subdue her, Triss led her colleague to safety.HugGeralt can reignite his romance with Triss in separate stages. While extracting Lady Ingrid Vegelbud's son from her estate past the witch hunters, Triss gets drunk, which leads to Geralt kissing her as the fireworks start. At the conclusion of Now or Never, if Geralt professes his love for Triss and kissed her previously, she seemingly departs on the ship for Kovir. But she returns, interrupting Sigismund Dijkstra's anecdote about his affair with Phillipa Eilhart. She asks to speak privately with Geralt at the lighthouse, where they have sex.While searching for Phillipa using hydromancy, Triss' spell in the reflection of the pool behind the Passiflora, changes to an unknown house. When pressed by Geralt, she reveals that King Tankred had offered her a position as his court advisor. She also reveals that the house is to be hers in Pont Vanis, where she wants them to live together after the Wild Hunt is defeated.If Geralt finds one of Triss' lost earrings in their bed back at Kaer Morhen, he can return it to her. During the epilogue, Geralt and Triss settle in far-away Kovir. Geralt would take jobs, more out of habit than need, due to the fortune Triss received as the advisor to Kovir's king. If Geralt romances both Triss and Yennefer, they trick him into thinking they're having a threesome, only to leave him tied to the bed in the Rosemary and Thyme.If Geralt romanced Triss in the main game, then she makes an appearance during Geralt's adventures in Toussaint.After the quest Blood Run, Geralt receives a letter from Triss that begins the quest Turn and Face the Strange. The letter is read in her voice and not only details the discovery she made about Professor Moreau's research, but also expresses a desire that Geralt remain safe and return to her quickly.During the quest The Warble of a Smitten Knight, Geralt can make the necessary vow for the knights' tourney on ""his lady's love"". In which case, he will say ""I vow on the love of my lady, Triss Merigold, to respect the chivalric virtues"".After the main questline for Blood and Wine is complete, Geralt can return to his home in Corvo Bianco and is surprised by Triss, who is waiting for him. After an embrace, the two venture outside to a sunny spot overlooking the vineyard. Once there, they have a conversation about various topics, including current events in Kovir and romantic plans the two have for each other in the future."

However, these boats happened to be taken from local peasants who weren't too pleased about this. The soldiers proceeded to get drunk and started singing Redanian songs when the peasants showed up, aiming to take back their boats by force. Trollololo tried to step in and help the soldiers, but due to his brute strength, he accidentally killed all the soldiers and peasants. Not wanting the ""meat"" to go to waste, he then cooked the bodies and ate them.However, believing he'd been recruited into the Redanian army now, he decided to take his orders seriously and constructed a fence out of some of the boats to guard the other boats and began to chant some of the Redanian songs.If Geralt lets it slide: Trollololo ""ordered"" Geralt to retrieve some paint as he had to stay behind to watch the boats. Geralt brought him some red and white paint which the troll used to have the Redanian coat of arms painted on his hut to make the place more ""official"".If Geralt decides to kill him: deciding it wasn't a good idea to have a man-eating troll so close to Oxenfurt, Trollololo was killed by the witcher."

While the two got along well enough, their father appeared to favor Aki, going as far as bestowing the family's heirloom sword Brokvar on the younger son rather than following Skelligan custom and giving it to the firstborn son, Udalryk. Enraged at this, Udalryk questioned his father's decision, breaking one of Skellige's sacred laws in doing so, and was subsequently punished by being chained to a pile in the sea for three days. Afterwards, to try and make amends, he and Aki went out on a sailing trip near Ulula's Needle when a storm broke out and Aki fell overboard. Udalryk, who had his hands full with the sails, didn't hear his brother's cry for help until it was too late and Aki drowned.Having failed to save his brother, Udalryk was overcome with immense guilt and sometime afterwards began to hear voices in his sleep that claimed they were messengers from the gods. These voices plagued Udalryk with strange visions and commanded he harm himself as a sacrifice to the gods, like cutting himself deep enough to leave scars, though he viewed this as a gift to hear from the gods so directly.Eventually he became the jarl of Clan Brokvar and by 1272 had his own son, who he named Aki in honor of his deceased brother."

There, he serves as a diversion for the Baron's men, akin to a ""court jester"" as per Geralt's description.Uma was first seen on Skellige by Skjall, before being picked up by the local jarl, Donar, who kept him for a time. He never intended to sell Uma but when a merchant who proclaimed a royal court on the main continent would love to have Uma as a jester and offered a great deal of coin for him, Donar sold him, though he found the idea of a jester laughable.The merchant then took Uma to Novigrad where he bumped into Phillip Strenger. They played several rounds of Gwent, in which Phillip kept winning, and as a last ditch effort, the merchant wagered Uma. Phillip decided to play the merchant again, more to give him another chance to win some of his money back than wanting Uma, but he ended up winning the last round and thus Uma came into his possession.Phillip then brought Uma to Crow's Perch where the being became an oddity and diversion for the keep's residents. Given that Uma ate very little, and did not prove troublesome, the Baron let him stay.Later, just as Geralt was informed that Ciri had taken off for Novigrad, Uma unexpectedly stumbled through the door, followed shortly by Sergeant Ardal who caught the creature and told them to ""pretend we were never here"" before leaving the room with Uma. Bewildered, Geralt questioned the Baron about what just occurred, who then told him how he won Uma.As Geralt investigated into Ciri's whereabouts, he finally concluded that Uma must be the key to finding her and started to take Uma with him to Kaer Morhen where he hoped to lift Uma's curse. However, the witcher was apprehended en route by some Nilfgaardian soldiers who escorted both Geralt and Uma to the Royal Palace in Vizima to talk to the Emperor. Emhyr var Emreis didn't appear thrilled to see Uma, and even less thrilled when Geralt suggested Uma could even possibly be Ciri, but nevertheless sent them on their way.At Kaer Morhen, Yennefer revealed that to lift Uma's curse she intended to subject him to the first stage of the Trial of the Grasses, which earned her the ire of the witchers there. However, Vesemir first attempted an alternative, safer procedure, taking Uma up into the mountains at midnight, and gave him hemlock tea. Vesemir was able to see that in Uma's relaxed consciousness, he had a different look in his eyes, as if he understood what was happening. Going up into the mountains to lift the curse ultimately failed, leaving no other choice but the Trial. Thus, Uma was restrained and imbued with The Decoctions of the Grasses while Yennefer maintained a stabilizing spell on him for an entire day in order to prevent the potions from destroying his organs. After the Trial, Uma successfully transformed into his real form as Geralt and Yennefer use a phylactery to catch and contain the curse that had transformed him in the first place."

"803","Vernon Roche","Human","Male","Commando Rank(s) Commander"," Blue Stripes Temerian Army Foltest","Krzysztof Banaszyk (Polish)Vernon Roche was the commander of the Blue Stripes, special forces of the Temerian military. Being Temerian, he held his king, Foltest, in high regard. He was also a capable fighter.Vernon Roche never met his father. He spent his childhood living in poverty. Having no money to live on, his mother was forced to work as a prostitute on the streets. Because of that, other children used to fling insults at him, calling him ""whoreson""; since that time, Roche reacts aggressively to this particular insult.Vernon admits that, if not for King Foltest, he would have ended up on the streets either as a vagabond or a drunkard.Roche has served for four years with the Blue Stripes unit. For his devotion and efficiency he was decorated twice with the Order of Bravery.According to Iorveth, he is responsible for the annihilation of many elves, women and children among them. Roche also led the ""pacification"" of Mahakam.Because of his capability, he became Foltest's right hand man and had a great deal of power and influence in Vizima.In the prologue, he interrogates Geralt about Foltest's killer, and begins to believe that Geralt had nothing to do with the assassination of Foltest. An unnamed 'contact' later revealed as Dandelion provides information about the real Kingslayer's whereabouts.At the start of Chapter I, Roche, Geralt and Triss encounter Iorveth, who attacks them due to the ongoing hostility between the Scoia'tael and the Blue Stripes. After saving Zoltan and Dandelion, Roche and his men occupy a building next to the inn. While Geralt is off performing tasks, Roche continues his hunt for Iorveth and the Kingslayer, culminating in a three-way battle between the Scoia'tael, the Blue Stripes, and Letho. During this battle, Geralt has the option of freeing Iorveth and returning his sword or siding with Vernon and the Blue Stripes. Failing to help him leads to Iorveth's capture by Roche. If you choose to side with Roche in Chapter I, you will lead an infiltration attempt to kill Flotsam's corrupt and treacherous Commandant.In Chapter II, Roche is revealed to be behind a conspiracy against King Henselt. After the conspiracy is discovered, King Henselt on the advice of mage, Dethmold, orders the execution of the entire Blue Stripes, except for Ves, whom Henselt rapes. Geralt and Roche escape the Kaedweni camp to intercept Síle in Vergen, which is under siege by Henselt's Army. The Sorceress manages to escape the city but Henselt and his Royal Guard, who were also looking for her, are defeated by Geralt. Roche is then either convinced that killing Henselt would only aid the Kingslayers and make him just as much a murderer as they are or allowed by Geralt to kill Henselt in revenge for the execution of the Blue Stripes.In Chapter III, Roche is one of the few remaining men still able to act in the interests of Temeria, and seeks to prevent the dissolution of his country at Loc Muinne. Vouching for Geralt, he manages to get the witcher access to the city, past the Order of the Flaming Rose even if Geralt sided against them.Meeting with Radovid V, Roche discovers that Anaïs La Valette was captured by Dethmold and agrees to rescue her and deliver her to Radovid. If Geralt decides to aid him, Roche will either keep his word to Radovid and deliver Foltest's bastard child to him, in which case he dons the Redanian colors and declares he will serve Radovid as the latter turns Temeria into a protectorate believing it the best way to protect Foltest's legacy, or he will be persuaded by Geralt to send Anaïs to John Natalis, in which case he will do his best to protect her and Temeria will remain independent. Either way, Dethmold is brutally murdered by Roche.Should Geralt decide to save Triss, then Roche will successfully rescue Anaïs on his own but will be unable to kill Dethmold, in which case Temeria will either be divided between Redania and Kaedwen, if Henselt remains alive, or fall into civil war.In the immediate aftermath of the events at Loc Muinne, Vernon Roche raced out to the front line and joined the 2nd Temerian Army under Natalis' command where they held defensive positions on the Dol Blathanna - Mount Carbon line in preparation for the coming Nilfgaardian invasion. However, after three days, the Nilfgaardian soldiers smashed through their lines and the Temerians scattered. Upon hearing of King Radovid's call to arms near Novigrad and promises to fight for a free North, Roche took the remaining forces and fought through to the west, breaking into the Pontar Delta in the hopes of attracting Redanian support. Alas, to his despair, Radovid was no different from Emperor Emhyr and thus he turned to guerrilla warfare.Still wanting to secure a free Temeria, he struck up an alliance with former Redanian spymaster Sigismund Dijkstra and former Temerian spymaster, Thaler. Realising that Radovid meant no hope for Temerian sovereignty, the group began plotting his assassination. In addition, Roche began contact with Nilfgaard, who promised to make Temeria an independent, vassal state to the empire in return for killing Radovid and stopping guerrilla attacks on its forces. Thus, Roche had his men undermine Redanian support in the area while not attacking Nilfgaardian troops. Likewise, Nilfgaardian troops were also ordered to leave the guerrilla soldiers be, supposedly under the pretext that they weren't much of a threat anymore.When Geralt started looking for Whoreson Junior in the area, Dijkstra sent him to Roche, who was now camping out in a large cave near Oxenfurt. After conversing for a bit, Roche then informed Geralt he had some luck, as he was about to head out to speak to an informant who might know more about Whoreson Junior. In Oxenfurt, Roche showed that his informant was none other than King Radovid V. After a conversation with the king, Geralt and Roche then left, with Roche saying that Radovid was sinking further into insanity and asking for the witcher to drop by as he needed help with something.Later, after the mages successfully escape Novigrad, Roche meets Geralt in the Passiflora with Dijkstra. They reveal their plan to assassinate Radovid, and that a contact of theirs who is essential to the plan hasn't reported back; this contact turns out to be Thaler, the former Head of Temerian Intelligence.The personal matter that Roche needed assistance with turned out to be Ves, who was openly defying Roche's orders and attacking a Nilfgaardian encampment without his approval. If Geralt agrees to assist Roche, they find Ves about to ambush an execution of the citizens of Mulbrydale. After killing the Nilfgaardians and saving Ves, Roche and Ves get into an argument over her disobedience. Geralt can offer his opinion. While they argue, they find that a Nilfgaardian officer survived. The two argue over whether they execute him or not, and again, Geralt offers his input.If you helped Roche with dealing with Ves, he can be recruited to assist in the battle at Kaer Morhen against the Wild Hunt. Roche agrees, and says he will head over immediately, once he gets some important matters taken care of.When you return to Kaer Morhen with Ciri, you have the option to engage in dialogue with Roche and Ves about the keep, the status of the guerillas, and what they think the outcome of the war will be. If Letho of Gulet was brought to the battle, it will instead be triggered as an automatic cutscene. The conversation will proceed as normal, until Letho interrupts it, commenting he's found some ""old friends"". Roche and Ves are angry at Geralt for bringing the man who killed Foltest to the keep, and refuse to speak to him.Later, when Geralt goes to retrieve Philippa Eilhart, if he does not break Djikstra's leg, he can optionally take part in the assassination, alongside Roche his guerillas.If Radovid is not assassinated: Radovid's forces defeat Nilfgaard and all of the Northern Realms, including Temeria, are annexed by Redania. Roche's fate is unknown.If Radovid is assassinated: When Radovid goes to retrieve Phillipa as part of a ruse, he sentences Geralt to death, saying his sarcasm and dry wit irritate him, and that he's killed people for much less. When the executioner asks Geralt for ""any last words"", a Temerian guerilla strikes the soldier in the back with an arrow, after which Roche and his men attack. They battle Radovid's men until they find the king banging on a door. Philippa then appears, blinds Radovid and stabs him in the back, shocking Roche.They later meet at the theater, where they discuss their next steps. Thaler reveals the deal he had made with Nilfgaard to secure Temerian sovereignty, before Dijkstra arrives. Dijkstra reveals his betrayal, stating that the deal meant giving the rest of the Northern Realms to Emhyr and was unwise. He continues, angering Roche further by saying that he'll fight for the North and unite all the kingdoms under Redania after defeating the invader, as his henchmen surround the group. Relying on the Witcher's neutrality, Dijkstra persuades Geralt to leave."

"806","Vesemir","Human (Witcher)","Male","Witcher"," School of the Wolf","Vesemir was the oldest and most experienced witcher at Kaer Morhen in the 13th century and acted as a father figure to Geralt and the other witchers. Like many of the other witchers, he spent each winter in the fortress and set out on the path when spring arrived.He was one of the few members of the School of the Wolf to survive the assault on Kaer Morhen. By the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; however, as he was only a fencing instructor, he didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples into witchers.[3]Considered among the oldest witchers remaining, Vesemir was born early enough to witness the construction of Kaer Morhen in the 11th century.[4] He was claimed by the Law of Surprise by a mysterious individual known as Deglan[5] and was brought to the Kaer Morhen valley to be trained as a witcher. His mentor and tutor was Barmin.[6]In the second half of the 12th century, Kaer Morhen was attacked by an enraged mob led by group of mages and priests. Vesemir survived, either not present in the keep during the pogrom[3] or mistaken as dead by the mob as he lied unconscious among the corpses of his fellows.[7][N 1] While the pogrom was condemned, the school never regained its full functionality.[3]Vesemir accompanied by witchers-in-trainingAfter the massacre, the school was run by Grandmaster Rennes, with Vesemir as second in command: a fencing instructor and precept for the witcher trainees,[1] replacing Varin.[6] At some point, he met Visenna outside Kaer Morhen, a sorceress who decided to give her child, a young boy named Geralt, to train as a witcher.[8] Vesemir became a father figure to Geralt,[9] but treated all young witchers with harsh affection.[1] Apart from participating in the school's life, Vesemir also took some witcher contracts. One of his famous deeds involved disenchanting the curse afflicting the ""Swan of Poviss"".[6]For some time, the School of the Wolf was funded by the monarchs of Kaedwen alongside the School of the Cat. Vesemir had to reluctantly cooperate with Guxart, the fencing master of the Cats. Originally not liking each other, the two grew to understand one another. The cooperation between the schools unfortunately had to cease, as the Cat Grandmaster Treyse and a group of students had secretly conspired with King Radowit II and the mage Astrogarus against the Wolves. A week before the planned tournament between the schools Vesemir and Guxart were put under arrest by king's men, thus spared from the massacre that occured. During the tournament, King Radowit betrayed both Cats and Wolves ordering his soldiers to shoot them all, resolving both his budget problems and imagined threats to his power in a simple but effective way.[1]Both masters – or, technically, acting grandmasters since Treyse's and Rennes's deaths – were released some time later and allowed to rebuild the schools, on the condition that the royal money would be never given to them again and that the schools must operate alone and unfunded.[1] The schools declined slowly, and the deaths of mage assistants and veteran witchers put a definite end to the Wolf School by the late 1230s or early 1240s, as children were no longer trained there after then.[3]During the winter of 1234, while fulfilling a contract in Oxenfurt, Vesemir briefly dated young lady Mignole. After noticing each other from afar, Vesemir received a secret letter from the woman inviting him. The two had a tryst, which was unfortunately interrupted by Mignole's father who'd learned of the affair. Vesemir fled, leaving his gambeson behind in the process, and had an arrest warrant for him put out by the father.[2]Wolves in their lairEven though the school ceased to function, Vesemir and other witchers used to spend winters at Kaer Morhen. He allowed some non-Wolf witchers such as Coën[3], but forbade the entrance for the renegades, as in case of Brehen whose massacre at Iello was exceptional even amongst the other Cats.[10]Likely around 1242,[N 2] Vesemir hosted Eskel's Surprise Child, Deidre Ademeyn, at the keep, which prompted a dyplomatic conflict with her brother and King Henselt's vassal, Merwin Ademeyn: Deidre was first in line to the throne, which did not suit her brother well. Ultimately the princess left the castle, however not without leaving a disfiguring scar at Eskel's face.[11]Old VesemirDecades later, Geralt brought his surprise child, Cirilla, princess of Cintra, to be trained as a witcher. Vesemir taught her about the different monsters and herbs, leaving the physical training to Geralt, Eskel, Lambert, and Coën. However, the witchers soon found out that Ciri was a source, as she entered into a trance when she accidentally drank white seagull. The third time, Ciri foretold the deaths of Geralt and Coën. The witchers then decided to summon an old friend, the sorceress Triss Merigold, to help Ciri, under that pretext that Vesemir's bones ached. Triss imposed some conditions to the witchers as she made them see the errors in their ways of treating Ciri, and Vesemir accepted the conditions despite the initial protests of some of the witchers.[3]In May 1272, on the trail of Yennefer, Geralt and Vesemir rode to White Orchard, where at a ford they encountered a merchant being trapped by a royal griffin. While fighting it, the old witcher suffered deep clawing to the shoulder. After freeing the man, they rode into the village to the local inn, and the two spoke to the innkeeper, Elsa, while a tense atmosphere filled the tavern. After Geralt met Gaunter O'Dimm, he spoke to Vesemir and decided to go to the Nilfgaardian Garrison.After getting some buckthorn to lure the beast, Geralt and Vesemir waited in a field hidden with bait set out, and after the griffin landed, Vesemir gave Geralt his crossbow that he had won gambling. After the beast was killed, and Geralt had handed in its trophy, him and his old master headed back to the inn, where they were violently attacked by some racists. Following their deaths, the two witchers were shunned and told to leave, where they encountered Yennefer and a Nilfgaardian escort outside the inn. Yennefer explained that Emperor Emhyr var Emreis had summoned Geralt to Vizima, so Vesemir decided that he would head north to Kaer Morhen.[6]Vesemir spent the next couple of weeks working at Kaer Morhen, patching crumbled walls, with Eskel and Lambert, until Yennefer showed up, preparing the witchers for Geralt and Uma's return to the keep, much to Vesemir's annoyance, as she showed little care for manners. Once Geralt arrived, everyone set out to prepare for the Trial of the Grasses that was to be performed on Uma, who Vesemir looked after until the trail was ready, taking him to the mountains, where he noticed in moments of complete relaxation, he behaved differently. Vesemir then put him into a trance and Uma spoke in a different voice. They all met the following morning and Geralt brewed the The Decoctions of the Grasses and started the trial on Uma, which Vesemir helped with but hated watching, remembering the painful history of their school. He slept through the trial until the end, when Uma transformed into Avallac'h, an elven sage, who revealed that Ciri was on the Isle of Mists and Geralt needed to find her. He also told them that when they took Ciri from the isle, the Wild Hunt would be able find her immediately, so Vesemir suggested that Geralt bring Ciri to Kaer Morhen and they all face the Wild Hunt together. He planned to spend the time preparing the keep for the coming battle with Eskel and Lambert.[6]After Geralt and Ciri returned via portal from the Isle of Mists, she was overjoyed to see Vesemir. Yennefer, Triss Merigold, Ciri, Geralt and Vesemir all discussed things and then headed into the main keep. On the way Vesemir discussed flammable gasses and patching up walls with Ermion. Then all the people that had turned up discussed battle plans in the main keep, with Vesemir suggesting that they brew potions in the laboratory and use tools to clear the rubble blocking access to the armory, and then he and Geralt finished it off by laying out the final plan.After a couple of hours, the Wild Hunt attacked, and Vesemir fought them on the walls of the lowest courtyard of the keep, briefly arguing with Ciri because she had left the inner keep against orders. Becoming overwhelmed and with Imlerith's arrival, they decided to retreat to the main courtyard. The Wild Hunt quickly broke through the gate and froze Geralt while Ciri and Vesemir hid at the top of the courtyard. Trying to protect Ciri, Vesemir was attacked by Imlerith, who he stabbed through the leg. He then cut Eredin Bréacc Glas who dropped Ciri, so Vesemir used Aard to push her far away. Imlerith then jumped on him and started beating and choking him, while Eredin started trying to convince Ciri to join him, much to Vesemir's horror. He spoke to Ciri begging her to run before stabbing Imlerith in the side. Imlerith, enraged, broke his neck, ending the old witcher's life.[6]In the game, Vesemir is one of the first people Geralt speaks to upon arrival at Kaer Morhen, and he is the one to guide the amnesiac through his first few uncertain steps around the keep. He also tells the witcher about skinning monsters, an extremely useful skill throughout the rest of the game. Of no less importance is the fact that he introduces the character of Berengar to the plot while filling our hero in on his forgotten past.Vesemir features prominently in the prologue and can usually be found wandering around the main hall on the ground floor of Kaer Morhen, or in the basement in the laboratory.In The Price of Neutrality premium module he is found just inside the walls of Kaer Morhen; more specifically, in the main courtyard. He can be found later near the ford closest to the camp.Vesemir mentoring young CiriVesemir returned in The Witcher 3 as a key character and was voiced by William Roberts once again. The game began with Geralt and his old mentor on the trail of Yennefer, the former having woken from a dream of Kaer Morhen. Whether or not they discussed the dream, Vesemir then requested to see Yennefer's letter, remarking that it smelt of lilacs and gooseberries, Yennefer's preferred perfume. Afterwards, they proceeded onto White Orchard to ask the townsfolk whether they've seen the sorceress in black. Both he and Geralt killed a Griffin in order to earn info regarding Yennefer's location. On their way back to the inn, they were greeted by Yennefer in person. There, Vesemir separated from Geralt, wanting to return to Kaer Morhen to hide its path from the Northern realms and the Empire of Nilfgaard as they waged war on one another.Vesemir disappeared for the majority of the game until Geralt returned to Kaer Morhen with Yennefer, then Ciri, where a group of resistance fighters were formed to fend off the Wild Hunt. During the battle, the King of the Wild Hunt detonated a magical explosion that froze all opposition, where only Vesemir and Ciri were unscathed. Vesemir tried to retreat with Ciri in tow but was immediately confronted by Eredin and Imlerith, the king and the second in command of the Wild Hunt respectively. Vesemir fended them off until Imlerith disarmed him, Ciri was then ready to surrender herself to the Hunt in order to spare everyone involved. In a last-ditch effort, but Vesemir stabbed Imlerith in the abdomen with a hidden dagger, causing the Aen Elle general to snap his neck, killing him. Distraught at this, Ciri unleashed her power in a massive soundwave of energy that forced the Hunt to retreat. After the battle, Vesemir was then given a funeral and honored as a hero against the Wild Hunt, Ciri took his Wolf medallion as a memento."

Angry at this behavior, Vespula started yelling at the bard while throwing everything out her window at him, including his lute, but Dandelion was able to catch it.Later on, while Geralt, Dandelion, and Dainty were trying to catch Dudu, a doppler that'd been impersonating the latter, she appeared in the same market the trio were searching. Dandelion, who felt he wouldn't do much good for the group, began to give a small show at one of the stalls and Vespula, armed with a frying pan, tried to make her way over to him to hit him upside the head, but he and the others scattered.A short time later, she spotted Dandelion once more in the same market and, catching him unawares, hit him on the head with the frying pan, knocking him out.

"830","Yennefer of Vengerberg","Quarter-elf","Female","Advisor Mage"," Brotherhood of Sorcerers King Demavend III of Aedirn Lodge of Sorceresses","Jenny[2]YenYennaHorsewoman of WarYennefer of Vengerberg, born during Belleteyn in 1173,[3] was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Supreme Council of Sorcerers within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.At some point, due to her magical potential, she was received in the Aretuza school for sorceresses, where rectoress Tissaia de Vries became her teacher and mother figure. During her training, Yennefer tried to kill herself by cutting both of her wrists, severing her tendons, though she survived. Tissaia claimed that the purposefulness of her attempt was the only thing that prevented her from feeling contempt for her weakness, and continued her training. In accordance with the sorceresses' tradition, any physical flaw, including her hunchback, was magically removed. Yennefer eventually graduated as a sorceress.[4]At some point, Yennefer set herself up in the town of Rinde and, ignoring King Heribert's rules that no magic users could stay in Redania, openly practiced her magic and provided her magical services to clients by staying with Novigrad's ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus granting her asylum from the law while in the ambassador's home. One morning, a witcher intruded on her sleep, revealing himself as Geralt of Rivia and that he needed her assistance in healing his friend, Dandelion, who had been afflicted by a djinn. After an initially rough greeting where Geralt responded sarcastically to her questions, Yennefer agreed to heal the bard, but she secretly made preparations in hopes of capturing the djinn, after Dandelion makes his final wish. When Geralt tried to stop her from using Dandelion, her spell took hold of the witcher, charming him to do her will against those on the town council who were against her. After Geralt is arrested, she has Dandelion, now awakened teleported out into town with instructions to make his wish to free Geralt. Yennefer tried to capture the djinn, but it fought her, destroying a good part of Rinde in the struggle, not knowing that the djinn's master was not Dandelion, but in fact, Geralt, who still held one wish. Geralt arrived to see Yennefer struggle with her spell, and he tried to stop her, leading them to fight one another. She got the better of him, and he revealed to her that he was the one with the last wish that could free the djinn. Geralt knew that the moment he made a wish, Yennefer would be too weak to contain the djinn and it would kill her. So Geralt saved their lives, by wishing their fates were tied together. Yennefer was grateful to the witcher, willing to bind himself to her, and the two began a relationship. TBAYennefer traveled to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander and spoke to Nenneke about a cure for her infertility. While she was at the temple, she spent time looking around for Geralt, and after discovering he wasn't there confronted Nenneke and ended up quarrelling with her, before leaving the temple.During the Battle of Sodden Hill she was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was later magically restored but she still bore the emotional scars.In May 1272, Yennefer sent Geralt a letter, arranging to meet in the village of Willoughby. However the village had been burned down, due to the Third Northern War reaching the region, so she headed through to the Nilfgaardian Garrison, passing through White Orchard in quite a rush. From the garrison, she headed to Vizima, meeting with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, concerning the location of Ciri. After a while, she heard Geralt was in White Orchard looking for her, so the sorceress rode with a Nilfgaardian escort to the White Orchard inn where she found Geralt and Vesemir. The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though she was nearly a century old. Yennefer had locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hung a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.Yen had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes she wasn't tall, was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs.She always dressed in black and white, at times wore stockings, wore frilled panties but never wore trivialities with underwire, she didn't need to. Her voice was resonant and mildly derisive. Her overall feminine shape was one of a twenty-year-old girl and she moved with a natural, unforced grace. She was a quarter-elf (meaning she had a quarter elven blood, in her case on her mother's side).It is implied that her attractive looks were a product of magic and had been acquired during her training, as with most other sorceresses. Geralt notes how her shoulders are slightly lopsided and by the end of the story realizes that Yennefer used to be a hunchback. Nevertheless, his love for her does not diminish.[6]Official The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt promo artwork by Marek MadejYennefer does not appear in the first game. During its events (year 1271), Yen is 98 years old. However, she is indirectly mentioned on several occasions.Yennefer in The Witcher 2 (flashback)Yennefer appears in flashbacks in the second game.In an optional encounter at the very beginning of the game Geralt (still without his memory) meets the Crinfrid Reavers where they mention that they were intending to rape the sorceress and not him (during the events of Sword of Destiny). Despite this they fail to remember her name believing her to be called ""Connifer"".In the end of the game it is revealed, that Yennefer is probably alive, but has amnesia like Geralt, and that she is located somewhere in Nilfgaard.Also, if the player decides to prevent Síle de Tansarville from being torn to bits, she will tell Geralt where to search for Yennefer.Yennefer was a playable hero in the now defunct MOBA, having been added with the Season 2 Update on 29 June 2015. Her alternative skin was called Ravenlord's Embrace and one of weapons was called Dark Moon weapon.In the third game, Yennefer is one of the main characters, and is voiced by Denise Gough. Her face was originally intended to be based on a 3D scan of Polish model Klaudia Wróbel,[7] however after initial in-game tests, the developers decided to reshape the face in order to give Yennefer a colder and meaner look.[8] Her first appearance is in the opening cinematic, wherein she is escaping from a battle between Nilfgaardian and Northern forces. Having recovered most of her memory, she has agreed to the serve Emperor Emhyr's interests in the hunt for Ciri. There is also a free DLC which gives Yennefer an alternative outfit.Yennefer had a note delivered to the witcher Geralt of Rivia stating that she needed to meet him urgently. Yennefer had given them a location to meet her, however the village was destroyed forcing her to flee towards White Orchard where Geralt alongside another witcher Vesemir lost her trail. Unknown to the witchers, Yennefer had then gone to Vizima, however as they had asked the nearby Nilfgaardian garrison commander for information about her location, the captain informed Yennefer of this. Knowning the witcher would be Geralt, Yennefer travelled to meet him immediately before taking him to Vizima to meet Emperor Emhyr var Emreis. En route, they are ambushed by the Wild Hunt, who slay their Nilfgaardian escort, before Yennefer destroys a bridge to prevent the Red Riders from pursuing them.As it turned out Yennefer had learned from the emperor that Ciri had returned to this world and that the Wild Hunt was pursuing her. After Geralt's audience, Yennefer explained that she had been using all manner of spells and rituals to try and track Ciri, only to alert the Hunt to her efforts. Therefore, she decided to rely on more conventional methods by turning to the best tracker she knows. She agreed along with Geralt to search for Ciri. She decided that he would search Velen and Novigrad for her whilst deciding to investigate Skellige herself.While on SkelligeGeralt later rendezvoused with Yennefer in Skellige during King Bran Tuirseach's funeral, where she explained that she suspected Ciri to be behind a cataclysm on the eastern end of Ard Skellig but Ermion, another of Ciri's tutors, refused to let her access the site, until they spoke with Crach an Craite. Afterwards, Yennefer and Geralt attended a wake at Kaer Trolde, where they stole the Mask of Uroboros, which possessed the ability to see the past events of the place it is viewed it. Upon arriving at the devastated area, they were confronted by Ermion, who warned them that it could only be used once and that using it will bring a cataclysm upon Skellige. As Geralt argued with Ermion, Yennefer went deeper into the devastated area and activated the mask, which caused a storm. Geralt ran to Yennefer and, using the mask's power, they found a place in the area where the elven mage had disintegrated a member of the Wild Hunt, then opened a portal and fled with Ciri. Ermion arrived soon after, and the two told him what they have found out. Ermion revealed to them that the Wild Hunt was recently seen on Hindarsfjall, so Geralt and Yennefer went there to investigate.Upon arriving to Hindarsfjall they went to the village of Lofoten, where the women were performing a ritual. Yennefer and Geralt interrupted them and asked about the Wild Hunt and Ciri. They were told that Ciri has been in the village, and that she was seen with a man they referred to as Craven. The two of them were in the stables right before the Wild Hunt arrived and attacked the village, killing many of its inhabitants. When asked about Craven, the women said that he went to the sacred garden near the village to defeat Morkvarg, some time after the incident, so Yennefer and Geralt went there to find him. In the garden, they found a body, and Yennefer decided to use necromancy to make it speak.The man's real name was Skjall. From what the body said, they learned that Ciri left with the elven mage on a boat as they were being chased by the Wild Hunt. Later on, Uma arrived on the same beach. After hearing the whole story, Yennefer forced the body to go back to its dead form. Yennefer's usage of necromancy drained all the magical power from the sacred garden, which the villagers of Lofoten didn't take lightly, and they blamed Yennefer and Geralt for not respecting their customs and beliefs. Still, Yennefer didn't care much about villagers' opinions, and she and Geralt ignored their claims. After leaving the garden, Yennefer asked Geralt to meet with her in Larvik, another village on Hindarsfjall, if he wanted to help her with something.Geralt met Yennefer at the inn of the village, where she told him she wanted to tame a djinn that belonged to a mage who sank his ship near Larvik harbor. They searched around the bay for the wreckage, until Geralt found a large crater on the bottom of the sea, and half of a seal inside it. He returned to Yennefer on the boat at the surface, and they concluded the mage asked the djinn to teleport him somewhere, which caused a part of the ocean's surface to teleport as well. Yennefer used the part of the seal to open a portal near the other half. Upon going through the portal, the two of them found themselves on top of a mountain, with the wreckage laying nearby.At this point, Yennefer confessed to Geralt that she needs a djinn to remove Geralt's last wish, which was to bind the two of them forever, so that she could see whether they truly love each other or if they are together because of the magical bond. The player can decide how Geralt would feel about this. Going through the wreckage, they found the other half. Yennefer connected the pieces which summoned the djinn. After a battle, they tamed it, and Yennefer commanded the djinn to remove the magic between her and Geralt. After this, they decided to sit on the edge of the ship, and Yennefer confessed to Geralt that she still has feelings for him. At this point, the player can decide whether Geralt also keeps his feelings for Yennefer or if he is no longer in love with her. This choice doesn't affect gameplay as much, but it is crucial to the ending itself, and Geralt's fate.After sitting some time on the edge of the ship, Yennefer opened a portal to her room at the Kaet Trolde inn, and they returned there. They knew Uma (also known as 'the ugliest man alive') was somehow important to finding Ciri, and assumed that it is probably a human, but under a curse. Yennefer decided to go to Vizima to report to the emperor, while Geralt went off to get Uma. Afterwards, they were to randezvous at Kaer Morhen and decide what to do with the cursed being.As Geralt was on his way to Kaer Morhen with Uma, he was intercepted by Nilfgaardian soldiers, and brought to Vizima to report to Emhyr himself. Yennefer was also there, and the two of them explained to the emperor what they found out and what their plans were. Afterwards, Yennefer teleported to Kaer Morhen, while Geralt went there on his horse with Uma. Upon arrival, she started ordering everyone around, ordering Eskel to collect forktail spinal fluid and for Lambert to imbue the phylactery with Power from the Circle of Elements.Subsequently, she attempts to contact Ida Emean via megascope but some interference cause her three separate megascope crystals to explode. When Geralt arrives, she has him search for the source of the interference, which turns out to be dimeritium bombs created by Lambert, which Yennefer suspected he planted out of spite. With that out of the way, Yennefer successfully contacted Ida, who translated the Elder speech riddle to be as old as the Aen Undod.In order to lift the curse, Yennefer reveals that she intends to put Uma through the first half of the Trial of the Grasses and to use a prolonged magical treatment on Uma to reconstruct his original body piece by piece. Using the phylactery Ciri had repaired, they were able to contain the curse. Uma is revealed to be a transformed Avallac'h, the elven Sage who helped Ciri, who revealed where their young ward was hidden.Yennefer was finally reunited with Ciri after so many years, but the happy reunion was short-lived, as the Wild Hunt descended on Kaer Morhen. Yennefer participated in the battle by putting up a magic barrier to force the Hunt's navigators to open portals outside the fortress.In the aftermath of the battle, Yennefer decided that they needed to reunite the Lodge of Sorceresses and managed to work out a deal with Emhyr, with the promise of amnesty and asylum for the Lodge if they help defeat the Hunt. She and Triss traveled to Novigrad to search for Margarita Laux-Antille and Philippa Eilhart respectively.Yennefer later met with Geralt at Crippled Kate's to wait for the one man who escaped Deireadh prison, who then panicked, assuming the both of them to be bandits and ran off. They managed to catch up with him and clear up the misunderstanding. Returning to Kate's, the escapee explained that his knowledge of herbs enabled him to use mushrooms growing inside his cell and belladonna to fake his death, tricking the witch hunters into throwing him into the corpse pit, which led to the sewers.Yennefer then devised a plan for Geralt to infiltrate Deireadh through Oxenfurt's underground elven ruins and provided him with a device to signal her to teleport in once he had found Margarita. However, she could only teleport Margarita out, forcing Geralt to find another way out on his own.The Witcher 3- Wild Hunt ""The Trail"" Opening Cinematic"

He also slightly changed his appearance by shaving his head.In 1272 he ended up in Novigrad where he was murdered by thugs near The Nowhere Inn on his way to join fistfights in Whoreson Junior's arena."
"837","Zoltan Chivay","Dwarf","Male",NA," Mahakam Volunteer Army Zoltan Chivay's company","Zoltan Chivay was a veteran of the Second Nilfgaard War and a friend of Geralt. They first met when Geralt and his company were going towards the Yaruga river from Brokilon, but the dwarf advised them to join his company and go eastwards. It is from Zoltan that Geralt got his sword - Sihil.He also had a talking parrot, Field Marshal Windbag, which he sold to the gnome Percival Schuttenbach when he started a jeweler's workshop in Novigrad.After the Battle of Brenna, where him and his mates killed Field-Marshal Menno Coehoorn, Zoltan got engaged to Eudora Breckenriggs.TBADuring the ensuing chat, the dwarf also mentions that his in-laws-to-be, the Breckenriggs (this name is spelled in a few different and interesting ways throughout the game: Breckering, Breckenridge, ...), who value material possessions more than Zoltan does. Lucky thing, since he has far fewer after the Common Cause Mine failed.Zoltan is the one to acquaint Geralt with dice poker, and to give him a couple of pointers about whom to challenge. After the initial meeting, he can be found in the Inn for the remainder of Chapter I.Later in the game, Zoltan can be found wandering around the Temple Quarter (roughly from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) and, if choosing to side with the Scoia'tael or take the neutral path, in the Old Vizima. He also often spends time with Golan Vivaldi. Arrives at Golan Vivaldi's home at 10:30 during chapter 2.If Geralt outdrinks him at the Inn, Zoltan will give him a Diamond.Zoltan once again appears in the second witcher game. His appearance has only slightly changed. Although originally expected to have the same voice actor as the original witcher game, he was ultimately voiced by Alexander Morton. His first appearance in the game is standing on a gallows platform in Flotsam during Chapter I. He is saved from being hanged (His crime? Colluding with the Scoia'tael) alongside another friend of Geralt's - Dandelion (himself accused of debauchery, or maybe setting fire to a tower, or possibly both!).Since they saw each other last, Zoltan's engagement to Eudora Breckenriggs has fallen through, as has his career in the mining industry, so he's settled for life as a ""simple merchant"", and occasional jewelsmith for a certain sorceress.After Flotsam, he heads to Vergen where he is reunited with his old pals, Yarpen Zigrin and Sheldon Skaggs.Zoltan Chivay was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA.Geralt meets Zoltan in Novigrad. Where he is throwing vagrants out of Dandelion's newly inherited tavern. Zoltan also wondering where Dandelion had disappeared to assisted Geralt and this lead them to Priscilla a Bard Dandelion was very close to. Upon discovering where Dandelion was and when he would be taken to Oxenfurt in a prison cart Zoltan organised an attack on it with several fellow Dwarves and Geralt."
