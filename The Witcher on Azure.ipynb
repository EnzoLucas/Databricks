I have always been a huge fan of fantasy movies, games and books and the Witcher is easily one of my favorites. For readers who do not know what or who the Witcher is, the Witcher is a fantasy series by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski basically describing the adventures of monster hunter Geralt. Recently, a Netflix series based on these books has also been released, which I would definitely recommend. Describing this work of fiction will only be of secondary interest to this article, however. The main focus will reside with **Azure Databricks**.\n\nDatabricks is a **“Unified Data Analytics Platform”** which works together with cloud provider Azure to provide an online environment for data science using Apache Spark. In this platform, data scientists, engineers and analysts can come together to work on big data challenges. While the world of big data is multifaceted, and the possibilities Databricks offers are numerous, I want to narrow down the scope of the article to Machine Learning in Databricks. Specifically **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.\n\nJohn Snow Labs, named after the English physician and not the Game of Thrones character, has developed an award winning open-source NLP library for Apache Spark. This framework can be easily integrated with Databricks, as they are both founded upon Apache Spark. This library offers a lot of out-of-the-box tools that are essential for NLP. For example, there is an in-built Entity Extractor, Tokenizer, Part of Speech Tagger, Named Entity Recognition and many more great features. They also offer pre-trained pipelines in multiple languages which allow you to identify words and sentences without having to spend (too much) effort in training a model yourself. This means you can instantly move on to the more interesting aspects of NLP. \n\nIn order to demonstrate some of these capabilities, I will perform a quick demonstration on some data I scraped from the internet. Using **R**, specifically the **rvest** library, I scraped the website witcher.fandom.com and extracted the character list containing all the characters that appear in the videogames. The wiki was particularly suited for a scraper, as all the pages follow the same layout. I performed some structuring and cleaning on the data in R, but I also left a block of raw text data that we will be using in this example.\n\nI exported the scraped data in CSV format to my local computer, but I could have moved it to storage in the cloud as well. For this you could use **Azure Data Lake Storage**, which is an easy to use, scalable data lake which is ideal for storing data such as a CSV file. On top of that, being part of the Azure environment it allows for an easy integration with Databricks. I would definitely recommend using this tool if you plan on working with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.  \n\nThe problem that I want to tackle on Databricks is a classification problem. Specifically, based on the textual description (which is in free form) I want to classify a character as either a Dwarf or an Elf. This information could always come in handy when you have to decide whether or not the character could be tossed (yes, I’m also a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings). All silliness aside, the classification problem posed here can easily be transferred to other, more real-life scenarios. For example, you could measure and **predict the likelihood of a purchase or the attitude** towards a product a person has based on his or hers recent LinkedIn post or an email sent to your customer support. Similar techniques can readily be deployed in the development of **chatbots**. In fact, the model that I will show here is a simplified version of the model that I am actively developing for a job. What I want to show is that with this piece of technology, the **possibilities are endless**. \n\nNow, without further ado, I will demonstrate the code. In Databricks I will be using **Pyspark**, although Databricks also offers support for **R, Scala and SQL**. You can follow along with this code, even when you do not have a paid subscription to Databricks as there is also a free Community Edition available. For more information see: https://databricks.com/product/faq/community-edition\n\nFirst, we need to set up the environment by loading in the required libraries and read in the scraped data that I uploaded to the Databricks filestore in CSV format. I also perform a quick inspection of the data using the code below. This data is typical of what you can expect from scraped data, as there are lots of ill formatted field and missing data."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# All functions needed to run this example\nimport sparknlp\n\nfrom sparknlp.annotator import *\nfrom sparknlp.common import *\nfrom sparknlp.base import *\n\nfrom pyspark.ml import Pipeline\nfrom pyspark.ml.feature import CountVectorizer, IDF, StringIndexer\nfrom pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator\nfrom pyspark.ml.classification import NaiveBayes\n\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":[" df = spark.read.csv(\"FileStore/tables/witcher_data-1.csv\",header=True)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":["display(df)"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .table-result-container {\n    max-height: 300px;\n    overflow: auto;\n  }\n  table, th, td {\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n  }\n  th, td {\n    padding: 5px;\n  }\n  th {\n    text-align: left;\n  }\n</style><div class='table-result-container'><table class='table-result'><thead style='background-color: white'><tr><th>_c0</th><th>name</th><th>race</th><th>gender</th><th>proffesion</th><th>affiliation</th><th>text</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NULL</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Abigail</td><td>Human</td><td>Female</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Abigail was a witch who lived in her house in the outskirts of Vizima. She was not well-liked by the villagers and got blamed for many bad or strange occurrences. Her main skill was alchemy, so though the villagers approached her with suspicion, they also relied on her for potions and poisons - which she provided, rarely bothering with questions or moral objections.In the course of Chapter I, Abigail took in the orphaned Alvin after Geralt saved him from the barghests as Shani could not care for him from an inn. She also facilitated a trance where the boy revealed more about the beast and its minions who were plaguing the village.Geralt can buy a blade coating formula from her that makes it easier to battle specters and ghosts. In fact, she buys and sells quite a few things:If her fate was left to the villagers, she cursed Geralt in the name of the Lionhead Spider, which she called the Black Legba. Whether this meant she was also responsible for the misdeeds of the other villagers is unclear.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Adalbert</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>Soldier</td><td> Order of the Flaming Rose Vizima City Guard</td><td>Adalbert was a crossbowman of the City Guard who fought in the ranks of the Order of the Flaming Rose.He participated in fierce battles to take control of the Trade Quarter, resulting in the Order winning a Pyrrhic victory. A seriously wounded Adalbert went with his remaining strength to the Cloister of the Flaming Rose in the Temple Quarter. Being in a state of agony, he informed Jacques de Aldersberg what happened, and then told the Master about the death of Roderick de Wett caused by Geralt. The Grand Master then thanked the soldier for his faithful service, just before Adalbert died from his wounds.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Adam</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Adam was the local poet in Murky Waters, his skills in that area were suspect at best. He was also not so secretly in love with Alina, was considered a fool by Alina's father Tobias Hoffman, and the rest of the village did not seem to have too high an opinion of him either. His occupation, other than aspiring poet, was unknown.Although his true love was ripped from this life by her jealous sister, Adam still clung to the dream of being eternally with Alina. It was during the first lonely days in a rat infested cell that Adam finally found his muse, and penned a poem for Alina.The example above is his finest work, ever, really. In a few conversations, we really get to plumb the depths of his oeuvre. It is bad enough that, at one point, Geralt asks him to simply stop speaking. Here is the poem which prompts the outburst:It might go on, but the witcher just stops him there.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Adda the White</td><td>Human (turned into striga as a result of a curse, disenchanted by Geralt of Rivia)</td><td>Female</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>\"Dyed red (games)Adda the White was the daughter of Foltest, king of Temeria. She was born a striga as a result of a curse cast by either Ostrit (a local magnate who loved her mother) or Sancia (Foltest's mother). The magnate was in love with the king's sister, the mother of the princess, whose name was also Adda. When he learned of the incestuous relationship between the king and his sister, Ostrit tried to put a curse on the king and this is blamed for Adda's transformation into a striga. However, Foltest's mother was also furious at the incestuous relationship between her children and may also have cursed their child. So it is possible that either Ostrit or Sancia, or both, were the cause of the curse.Adda was named for her mother who died during the birth. Her nickname \"\"the White\"\"</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Alina</td><td>Human</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Alina was a young girl from Murky Waters and the daughter of the village chief, Tobias Hoffman. She was to be married to Julian, a rich merchant from Kovir, much to the disgust of her jealous sister Celina and the poet Adam, who was secretly in love with her.She can initially be found in her house in the village of Murky Waters. Later, once she becomes a noonwraith, she usually hangs out near the ruin mill in the Fields.She seemed strangely resigned to marrying Julian and appeared fond of him, at least in a way, but she also showed no intention whatsoever of ending her affair with Adam which she carried on every day at noon, in the raspberry patch in the fields. She did seem jealous of Celina's attempts to gain Julian's attention, even though this last endeavor was proving fruitless.She had also developed quite an attachment to Alvin. She would have dearly loved to have adopted him and raise him with Julian, but Julian was not so taken with the prospect of raising a child who was, from all reports, a source.The jealous rivalry with her sister reached a peak one day when Celina started to argue with her, near the Raspberry patch, and ended up pushing Alina down and causing Alina to hit her head on a rock, killing her instantly. Because she was murdered in this manner, Alina arised as a noonwraith, doomed to forever roam the fields.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Alvin</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>\"Alvin was a boy who managed to escape the barghest attack which cost his foster mother her life. As a result of the shock, he started to divine the future and uttered the Prophecy of Ithlinne. It is supposed that Alvin was a Source, having magical powers he couldn't control.Alvin lived with Abigail until the Reverend snatched him while collecting water for Abigail. The preacher gave the orphan to a group of Salamandra lackeys, who demanded that the dwellers of the Outskirts surrender their children.In Chapter III, Geralt finds Alvin a second time. This time the boy is being held at St. Lebioda's Hospital, until he is kidnapped by Salamandra once again. In Chapter IV, Geralt finds the boy a third time, in the village of Murky Waters.Many fans of the game believe that Alvin is actually the Grand Master of the Order, Jacques de Aldersberg. When the fight between the elves under Toruviel and the Order of the Flaming Rose erupts in full force in the village of Murky Waters, Alvin teleports himself away because he is frightened by an elven warrior. Alvin's ability to teleport himself through time and space stems from the fact that he is a source. It is widely theorized that he flees to the past, perhaps back to where he was raised, and ultimately incorporates what he had learned with Geralt, accepting his perceived fate and becoming the Grand Master.Clues that speak to this hypothesis include the dimeritium pendant Alvin wears. Alvin, the boy has one as does the Grand Master; only difference is that Aldersberg's amulet shows years of wear. But the previous hint, that he went back to time with everything, clothes, knowledge etc. explains it. Another hint lies in the mention that Alvin's favorite game is \"\"kill the elf\"\" where he always plays the Grand Master and wins. Also</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Angus</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Angus was a local drug dealer who was known to the City Guard, well, at least to Jethro. He was a shady character who can usually be found standing on the corner near The Hairy Bear, the kitty-corner from the Eager Thighs brothel, or in the slums of the Temple Quarter.Geralt must find Angus and get from him information about the Salamandra drug trade in Vizima. It is from him that Geralt gets the information to locate the Salamandra hideout where the manufacture of fisstech seems to be based. He can get this information either by paying the dealer for a letter of recommendation in order to enter the drug lab with minimal fuss or taking that same letter from him by force. Alternatively, our hero can simply enter the lab using force and dispense with the letter altogether.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Antoinette</td><td>Human</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Corbin (cousin)Ramerot (cousin)Jean-Pierre (fianc�)At the beginning of Chapter V. Her cousins, Buse, Corbin and Ramerot are in hiding in the refugee caves in the swamp cemetery after incurring the disfavour of the king and they are completely out of orens.When Geralt speaks to Antoinette, she mentions that she recognizes Geralt because in her home many years ago, she saw him dancing all night with a sorceress that he was very fond of.Geralt doubts this due to his inability to dance. Antoinette questions if all Witcher's have white hair; Geralt says he is the only one, and she says she must be confused because she remembers him dancing with a sorceress.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Azar Javed</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>Alchemist Mage</td><td> Salamandra</td><td>\"Azar Javed was a Zerrikanian sorcerer and alchemist who took part in Salamandra's attack on Kaer Morhen. Initially known only as the \"\"mysterious mage\"\"</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Berengar</td><td>Human (Witcher)</td><td>Male</td><td>Witcher</td><td> School of the Wolf Salamandra</td><td>\"The witcher that was first mentioned by Vesemir, Berengar had left Kaer Morhen before Geralt's arrival.After a long search through the swamp, Geralt finds a cloven Salamandra medallion, along with Berengar's belongings leading him to conclude that Berengar must be dead. However, in Chapter IV, Geralt finds Berengar, still very much alive just outside of Murky Waters.Berengar and Geralt work together briefly, before Berengar explains why he left Kaer Morhen. He voices his disdain for the Witchers, whom he holds responsible for denying him a normal life. Later, on Black Tern Island, Berengar confronts Geralt with the intention of challenging him to a duel, forcing Geralt to choose once again, his next course of action.If he spares Berengar, then Geralt will have an ally to aid in the final battle with Azar Javed. If he duels with Berengar (as Geralt tells Berengar, just before the fight), only one can come out alive and Geralt prevails. This leaves Geralt with Berengar's remaining belongings, which include a powerful medallion, so powerful in fact, that Azar Javed cannot fail to notice it in the final battle.Note that when Azar Javed kills Berengar (if Geralt spared him earlier), the powerful medallion cannot be found on his corpse.It is actually possible to prevent Azar Javed from killing Berengar at the end of Chapter V, but nothing happens between Geralt and Berengar if this is the case. When the player clicks on Berengar, the witcher says: \"\"I needed time to think\"\" as a normal NPC would do</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NULL</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Blacksmith's son</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>\"The blacksmith in Murky Waters does not live alone, nor is he the only merchant.

Her husband is carrying on with a succubus and she would like an end to it.

She loved sapphires, in any form, as they supposedly brought out the beauty of her eyes. She also had a mysterious scar on her neck, left by a vampire.She ran away from home to get away from her controlling brother but he wanted her to come back and marry the man he chose for her.

The two of his compatriots were Kennet and Gar.[1]Together with his comrades he managed to slay three red and one black dragon as well as wiped out all of the dracolizards and forktails in Redania. Their fame became so notorious that even Geralt of Rivia admired their skill.For the main article on this hunt, see The Bounds of Reason.In 1254 the Reavers were hired by Niedamir to help in hunting green dragon Myrgtabrakke. This turned harder than expected � Myrgtabrakke had a baby and was protected by golden dragon Villentretenmerth who injured Boholt's head during the fight.By the time of 1271, when Kennet and Gar met again with Geralt, they could tell him only a sad tale of what became of their leader after the dragon hunt.

Her girls could be found plying their trade all around the Temple Quarter, and even on the dike. She, however, prefered to stay close to her base of operations, and so is usually found either directly outside the brothel, or just inside keeping the place tidy.She had protection arrangements for her girls in place with the local underworld, but on occasion must've call upon extra help with some of the nastier elements of the trade. Since Salamandra had moved into town, no one was safe. In Working Girls, she asked the witcher to help three of her girls who were being menaced.She was one possible choice of guest to invite to Shani's party, though probably not a welcome one. That was all right, as it turned out that she was in love with a werewolf anyway, but she would not reveal his identity, in case Geralt decided to kill him. This left the witcher no other choice than to find out for himself.It was not Geralt's investigation however, that revealed the werewolf's identity. A chance encounter in the restricted part of the Trade Quarter lead to the surprising discovery that Carmen's lover was none other than Vincent, captain of the City Guard. Once she realized that Geralt knew that Vincent was the werewolf, she begged him to help find a cure.She also enjoyed a good round of dice and was a novice player herself.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>Caroline</td><td>Human</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Fandom may earn an affiliate commission on sales made from links on this page.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>Celina</td><td>Human</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>\"Celina was Tobias Hoffman's elder daughter.

However, he didn't let his feelings get in the way when he saw that Geralt was also infatuated with Yennefer and even pulled the others away when he saw the two having sex in his cousin's destroyed inn after fighting off a djinn.In Chapter IV, at the Lakeside, Chireadan, an elf among Toruviel's ragtag group recognizes Geralt. It seems he knows the witcher from somewhere before, but of course Geralt has no memory of him. This previous encounter, which is not described in any further detail, is a reference to the The Last Wish.He is also a sharper, and thus one of the available dice players. He can be found any time, day or night to play. During the day, he is typically sitting at one of the two campfires nearest the Elven Cave. At night, he will be sleeping in the cave, but does not complain at all about being woken up just for a game.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>City Guard is what passes for law and order in the day-to-day lives of the residents of Vizima and the Outskirts.Viziman guard appears also in polish graphic novelization of short story the Witcher illustrated by Boguslaw Polch.In The Witcher, city guards are stationed at all gates and also roam the streets. They also help Geralt fight salamanders and other monsters if they happen to be nearby. Their default behaviour is to help the witcher. They are based out of the city dungeon. The captain of the City Guard is Vincent Meis.Geralt can attack some members of the city guard, but only those who have a blue base (circle on the ground). Those with green bases can not be attacked.If Geralt accidentally angers a city guard (with a blue base), say by attacking them, their attitude toward Geralt becomes hostile and their base and labels turn red as will those of any affiliated NPCs in the area. This means that the fight is on. Not all NPCs will suddenly attack, only those NPCs which can attack Geralt will do so, but commoners will simply cower in fear.If Geralt kills one of the city guards, a warrant with royal gold will be sent. This action will summon a relentless headhunter (or more accurately, a relentless and unending series of headhunters). Geralt can choose to engage a headhunter in battle or pay 1000 . However, it is extremely difficult to kill a headhunter and since killing one only summons another, the best solution is to run away before killing any guards (eventually they do revert to their non-hostile state) or pay up.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NULL</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NULL</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>Coleman</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>\"Coleman was known as a \"\"white death merchant\"\" by the elves.

Because of the dire situation they found themselves in, the elves accepted any food, including wyvern meat and gutted fish.They also had one elven sorceress among them which, despite a quite combative attitude, could be wooed by Geralt of Rivia if he gave the group food of some kind apart from bread.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>Erkyn von Blunt</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Erkin von Blunt, otherwise known as Thaler's mute friend at A Posh Reception.

As the sorceress Triss Merigold noticed, Eskel emanated a strong magic aura. Though less famous than his peer Geralt of Rivia, Eskel became renowned in his own right as a professional, reliable witcher, and possessing a kind and relaxed disposition.Eskel and the White Wolf were like brothers. Side by side they grew up, enjoyed pastime activities and endured the witcher trials. A good friend of younger Lambert and Co�n of Poviss, Eskel saw Vesemir as both a mentor and a father figure. He returned to Kaer Morhen each winter to swap tales and rejuvenate for The Path.Born in mountains, Eskel originated from hill-folk. His mother used to sing him an old hiking tune about a hen, which would later be the only thing the witcher remembered of her.[1]Under unknown circumstances, The Witchers' Settlement in the Blue Mountains eventually became his home. He befriended Geralt, a peer who gradually turned into his almost-brother. Together they relished in childish delinquencies. Once, Eskel and Geralt had captured a huge forest bumblebee and tied it to a jug. Watching its antics, the two had fits of laughter until Vesemir had caught and punished them with a leather strap.[2]Tirelessly studying all sorts of creatures, trainees got to hear teachers repeat jokes about virgins and unicorns or basilisks and mirrors, quickly finding all unamusing. The one they found most primitive�infinite versions of how a young witcher shook his hand with a female dragon.[3] To become full-fledged witchers, the youth had undergone murderous and painful Changes together, the Trial of the Grasses which changed their physiology, granting them, among other things, cat-like vision in the dark. Young Eskel feared for his friend's life when Geralt's hair turned white as a side effect of the Trial, though both managed to beat the odds and survive it together. They trained on The Trail.

The Lady herself suggested that he was her lover, on at least one occasion.At his hut, Geralt found him to ask about borrowing his boat to get to Black Tern Island. His mostly silent nature thankfully didn't pose a problem, and he relented.[1]In 1275, the Fisher King and the hermit followed the Lady of the Lake to Lac C�lavy in Toussaint.

While in Vizima, he owned a house in the nonhuman district of the Temple Quarter, right next door to Golan Vivaldi and just around the corner from Shani.At some point, after a turmoil caused by the Order of the Flaming Rose and Scoia'tael, he moved into Novigrad where he lived his ordinary life until he was captured by witch hunters and subsequently burned at the stake.Adalbertus Aloysius Kalkstein was a Master of Alchemy who, for the most of his life, inhabited a house in the non-human district of Vizima's Temple Quarter, in a neighborhood with dwarven banker Golan Vivaldi. However, at times, he would leave the city and travel to Oxenfurt where he would attend scientific discussions and convents.Kalkstein was the author of many alchemical works, including a treatise called Transmutations and Metamorphoses analyzing attempts to animate inanimate matter, an activity otherwise known as constructing a golem. The alchemist has been interested in this matter for years but due to his convoluted style, his work was difficult to read.Apart from being a very powerful alchemist, Kalkstein also knew a great deal about gnomish technology and elven mastery of crafting armor. To fund his researches and experiments, he ran a shop in his house and sold items related to alchemy such as books and scrolls, Ginatz's acid (15), white vinegar (20), Sulfur (30), Albar's crystals (40), a few talismans, like garlic and red ribbon, barghest skulls, wolf pelts, alp fangs. He also bought White Raffard's Decoction and Wives' Tears if someone offered him.[1]Geralt and Kalkstein first met in the Outskirts where the state of quarantine was making it difficult for anyone to enter the city, and the alchemist was no exception. While Kalkstein waited to have his pass accepted, he bided his time at the local Inn.The witcher immediately recognized that the alchemist was very interested in anything alchemical or unnatural. On his first encounter with the witcher, he asks if he can examine his body for scientific purposes. When Geralt took exception, he then relented and asked if he could perform an autopsy upon his death. This did not really go over well either so they changed the subject and never returned to such discussion.Geralt met Kalkstein a second time at the Merchants' Gate, where he was threatened by Salamandra bandits who intended on taking his equipment, by force. After a quick round of swordplay, thugs were dispatched and a grateful alchemist offered Geralt a reward: his services anytime the witcher is in Vizima, at a discount. It was also at this point in his journey that Geralt realized the full extent of the repercussions of the theft of the Witchers' Secrets from Kaer Morhen and his resolve to track them down and make them pay is renewed.Once Geralt got out of prison and took up his investigation of Salamandra, it did not take long before the name, \"\"Kalkstein\"\" cropped up again.

In Chapter I he appears in the Outskirts along with the ghost of Leo. In Chapter IV, Geralt must be careful not to summon him while completing a quest for the Hermit. These encounters culminate at the end of the game and true to form, the witcher is faced with another dilemma, as the King has come to claim the soul of Jacques de Aldersberg.During his final conversation with Letho, Geralt recalls his forgotten memories, remembering that Eredin found him and Yennefer at the Isle of Avalon after Ciri rescued the two from the riot that took place in Rivia. The Hunt attacked Geralt and Yennefer soon after, taking the sorceress captive after laying waste to the island.Geralt had began searching for Yennefer, along the way he gathered the witchers of the Viper School and engaged the Wild Hunt in an attempt to rescue her but the Hunt far outnumbered them.

It is tough being the object of adulation and reverence. While most locals will tell you that they love the Lady, they would never dream of actual physical contact with her. In this regard, Geralt has no such qualms and can generously provide companionship of the more mundane kind.To obtain the dialog option to romance her, Geralt must first speak to the Hermit after speaking to her and ask him about the grail.

After the Battle of Brenna, in which he avenged one of his mates Caleb Stratton, Bruys planned to do business in Novigrad. Eventually, he ended up a bouncer in Vizima.A dwarf born in Mahakam, Bruys joined Chivay's band.[2] For several days, bard Jezkier traveled and sung by their side. During one such day, their camp had been approached by Brendan. Bruys grew warry but Chivay calmed him, introducing Brendan as an old friend.[3]Once, the group waylaid and robbed a rich hawker who tried to flee Dillingen after townfolk exposed his trade with Scoia'tael. The merchant defended his property like a lion, shouting for aid a few times until the dwarves got him with batons. Intending to fund future enterprises of each individual with the treasure, Bruys helped load the trunks on a wagon.In late summer 1267, Bruys and the rest had been escorting Kernow refugees, mothers and children, to safety. They met Geralt of Rivia and the witcher's own group for the first time on a way toward the Yaruga river from Brokilon. Chivay advised Geralt to join up with dwarves on a way eastward. When the large group became short on provisions, Bruys and Yazon Varda vanished into the dark, only to return at dawn with two full sacks, one with horse grub and the second with jerkies, cheese, huge haggis and more refreshment. Another time, he and Figgis Merluzzo went mushroom picking. Later on, Percival Schuttenbach sensed porridge with his infallible gnomish nose and stated people had to live nearby. Chivay decided he, Schuttenbach and Geralt's companions would investigate, while Bruys and Merluzzo awaited for a signal in a form of a sparrowhawk call. Bruys anxiously asked Chivay when he learned bird sounds. Chivay answered the point was if Bruys heard an unrecognizable sound, he would know it's them.After crossing Brugge, the group stopped at O. Convinced not to carry the treasure any longer, Zoltan ordered Bruys, Varda, Merluzzo and Caleb Stratton to hide it. The rest continued to Fen Carn. Much later, during an unexpected battle between the refugees-killing Nilfgaardian Army and the Temerian Army, Chivay's company reunited. They evaded death by running to the woods, but Stratton was hit by the 7th Daerlanian Cavalry Brigade. After burying Stratton and mourning his passing, the dwarves continued. They met Geralt and his company once more, in Angren, and Bruys gave each member a strong handshake. At long last, the company decided to return home to Mount Carbon.[2]Bruys fighting at Brenna.As the end of the Second Northern War had drawn near, Bruys and Merluzzo were part of officer Zoltan Chivay's unit of the Mahakam Volunteer Army. In spring 1268, most regiments sent by Elder of Mahakam Brouver Hoog suffered great losses and were withdrawn to Vizima. With time to recover, most dwarves enjoyed beer and fist-fighting at The Shaggy Bear tavern.To stop the advancing enemy, Temeria mustered its forces and prepared for the Battle of Brenna. Thousands of dogged dwarven volunteers commanded by Colonel Barclay Els stood the right-wing.

Following the Peace of Cintra, he agreed to start one in Novigrad with Merluzzo and Chivay.[4] However, the mutual venture flopped.[5] Bruys returned to Vizima, moving there for good as he landed a bouncer position at The Shaggy Bear. A self-titled professional dice player, Bruys earned bonus orens gambling.In 1270, Bruys kept in touch with Zoltan Chivay who told him witcher Geralt, thought dead since pogrom in Rivia, lived. Initially refusing to believe, the dwarf welcomed Geralt with open arms when the witcher entered the tavern in Temple Quarter. When asked, Bruys praised his job as peaceful and reminded Geralt of past adventures.[1]</td></tr><tr><td>92</td><td>Murky Waters blacksmith</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>The blacksmith is a very versatile fellow.

Alongside Geralt, the four Viper witchers fought against the Wild Hunt, until Geralt exchanged himself for Yennefer. Out of respect for their departed comrade, the Vipers took care of Yennefer, who, suffering from amnesia, began to cause trouble for the group. Eventually, all of them were captured by the Nilfgaardian secret service. In custody, they were approached by Imperator Emhyr var Emreis, who offered to rebuild their school if they sowed chaos in for him in the Northern Kingdoms by killing its kings.[2]Critical momentIn September 1270, he managed to enter the Temerian Royal Palace in Vizima just when Geralt, who lost his memory shortly after their last meeting, was in the process of receiving his reward for destroying Salamandra and killing the Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, Jacques de Aldersberg.The renegade witcher snuck past all the guards, killing two of them in the process and almost killed King Foltest. Before anything else could happen, Geralt rushed to the king's aid; a hard-fought battle broke out in which the dual-wielding assassin got the upper hand, so Geralt threw his recently-acquired coin pouch at his former comrade to stun him, before cutting off his arm and killing him with a slash across the back. The dead assassin was not recognised by Geralt due to the latter's amnesia, however, and his corpse underwent an autopsy to find out who he was.[3]The witcher lying dead in front of Geralt and FoltestImmediately after his death, he was searched over by royal medics in the palace until they passed his body to Triss Merigold.

His reign became, along with witch hunts, one of the defining factors of the post-war period that followed the Peace of Cintra. Radovid was a polarizing figure: a brilliant strategist and a superb general by some, a paranoid madman by others. There were also many who took the middle view of his policies being harsh but justified.He inherited his titles and estates as the only son of King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore. His two older sisters were Dalimira and Milena. Even though his father died in 1267, Prince Radovid didn't succeed him immediately because he was only twelve at the time and for several years the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council under influential Duke Nitert and Count Sigismund Dijkstra, the then-spymaster of Redanian Secret Service.Radovid bore a deep aversion towards mages that stemmed from his father being secretly assassinated by an unknown elf at the behest of the sorceress advisor Philippa Eilhart,[N 3] who then pulled strings from behind his back, ruled in his name and dominated and demeaned him throughout his youth.Radovid was born in 1255 in Tretogor to the royal pair, King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore, as their third child. He grew up with two older sisters: Dalimira, informally known as Dalka, and Milena, who was known as Milka in a similar fashion. Dalka eventually dedicated her life to the priesthood after her failed engagement with King Foltest of Temeria, who instead chose to marry his own sister Adda, while Milka attended Aretuza to become a sorceress Millegarda.[2]When Prince Radovid was 9 years old he was formally engaged to Cirilla, Princess of Cintra, when she was 12. The engagement was formalized between his father and Queen Calanthe, Ciri's grandmother, but the king broke the engagement off after half a year without giving any explanation and Ciri and Radovid never even had a chance to talk to each other.[3]On the day of the outbreak of the Second Northern War with the Nilfgaardian Empire, his father had unexpectedly fallen victim to an elven assassin.[4] A fact unknown to practically anyone was that it was Philippa Eilhart, at the time fighting on Thanedd Island, who hired the elf in order to gain more direct rule. Redania fell into chaos, as usually happens in such circumstances, and Queen Hedwig was not in a state to control things.[N 3] The aristocracy started to organize itself into factions, attempting to tear some land out for each and every one of them. Several practically licked the boots of Nilfgaardian emissaries led by Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen and were ready to rule with Nilfgaardian blessing, only to be caught off guard and stopped by the famous Redanian Secret Service. There remained but a handful of those who were spared, those with important enough social status and armed might to maintain peace, like Duke Nitert.[4]Nitert was put in charge of the Regency Council appointed to save the realm from a total civil war and they managed to do so, by hanging everyone they deemed traitor in specially modified fortifications with internment camps - most infamous of which would be Drakenborg. Its members, however, overlooked their underage crown prince and none of the Northern Kingdoms' elites, not even Philippa who took it upon herself to raise him, expected him to grow into a firm monarch who would repay all humiliations he and his mother had suffered during the interregnum.A young but decisive, unrelenting King Radovid V's deed quickly earned him the epithet of \"\"the Stern\"\".[5]He began his reign by taking care of various nobles who ruled on their lands rather independently from Tretogor.

His preferred base of operations is in the back room of The Hairy Bear. He also seems to have some sort of arrangement in place with the innkeeper, but the nature of the agreement is murky at best.The second place is his home where he is usually accompanied by Coleman, who is part of his little criminal organization. However he is rarely home, leaving it to be guarded by two of his henchmen.He seems to have an inexhaustible supply of minions, and he is apparently not too bothered by their frequent turnover due to shortened lifespans. Depending on the timing, if Geralt kills the two bouncers guarding Ramsmeat's house, they are simply replaced by two more the very next day. Moreover, killing the bouncers provides a key to his place saving Geralt 20  he would otherwise have had to pay in order to get inside each time.In the Side Effects premium module, he still introduces himself with his real name, Jeremiah Trick. He reveals that he is working for Vizima's underground leader, Mr. Glover, but intends to take over his position and make his name known in the entire city. Geralt recommends him to use a more memorable nickname in place of his real name, apparently resulting in him adopting the alias Ramsmeat, though he tells our witcher to shove off and doesn't seem to recognize him in the main game.</td></tr><tr><td>118</td><td>Rayla</td><td>Half-elf (games)</td><td>Female</td><td>Mercenary Rank(s) Officer</td><td> Aedirnian Special Forces (formerly)Order of the Flaming Rose (games)</td><td>\"Rayla of Lyria,[1] known first as Black Rayla[2] and later as White Rayla,[3] was a natural-born soldier and a veteran of the wars with Nilfgaard. She was a mercenary and later an officer of the special forces of King Demavend of Aedirn. While she was guarding the withdrawal of civilians from invaded Aedirn, her unit was wiped out by Scoia'tael commandos.[2] She survived the capture, albeit maimed and disfigured.[3]She early became a mercenary and departed for adventures. At some point in her life she met Geralt of Rivia, witnessed his fighting skills, and became impressed by them. She also visited Vengerberg a few times, meeting the sorceress Yennefer.She fought for Nordlings during the First Northern War. Later, she participated in a gathering at Bleobheris, during which she watched Dandelion's performance and discussed with other spectators the events described in his ballad.[1]Some time later, Rayla joined the special forces formed by King Demavend. In June 1267, she was tasked with escorting Archmistress Tissaia de Vries to Gors Velen. There, Yennefer argued that Rayla, as a mercenary fighting for money, would not be able to make sacrifices like soldiers who defend their own country and homes, while Margarita Laux-Antille defended the warrioress. Yennefer's predictions would later prove untrue.Alas, the Nilfgaardian invasion proceeded without obstacle and what remained of Rosberg was burned ruins. One of the few survivors, Xavier Lemmens, informed Queen Meve and Rayla that King Demavend left Rosberg before the siege and was now preparing his defense at Aldersberg.At Aldersberg, the unit finally met King Demavend; Nilfgaardian troops commanded by Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn, however, had already started besieging the city.[4]In the end Lyrians and Aedirnians joined forces and clashed against the Nilfgaardians in what would be later known as the First Battle of Aldersberg. Although Meve and Demavend's troops were defeated and Aldersberg was burned down, the two monarchs managed to save both their lives and those of the citizens of Aldersberg.[2]Following the battle, Demavend fled to Redania. Before leaving Meve, however, he handed her the Leaden Ring, a token which would've given her permission to enter the enclave of Mahakam and ask for military help from Brouver Hoog, the Elder-in-Chief. The King of Aedirn also tasked Rayla with escorting the Queen to her destination.In Mahakam, Rayla was forced to leave Meve because she had to return in Aedirn, since Nilfgaardian troops were now heading towards Demavend's capital, Vengerberg.[4][N 1]Rayla surrounded by Scoia'taelAfter the Battle of Vengerberg was won by Nilfgaard, Rayla's unit protected the civilians fleeing through the Pontar Valley to Temeria. When the Aedirnian army's rearguard was obliterated by Scoia'tael, she ordered her men to stay and become the rearguard themselves, despite their reluctance. She was the last to stand after a fierce battle, surrounded by Scoia'tael. They asked her to drop her weapon, but she replied her sword was too expensive to drop and if they wished to take it, they should break her fingers to do so.[2]Rayla appears again in 1268 � not with broken fingers but missing her whole hand, replaced by a steel hook.

Since he was also a nobleman of some moral code and kind heart, Siegfried got along rather well with the witcher Geralt of Rivia and their friendship changed his life forever.Siegfried was born sometime in the 1250s to pious Sir Eyck of Denesle and his wife Sophia.[1] His parents raised him at Castle Denesle, teaching him knightly code of honor.At one point, a serious illness struck Siegfried's mother. He immediately ran to his father and implored him to earn coin for her betterment by demanding payment for next few beasts he would slay. Eyck, however, refused so as to not stain his reputation. This angered Siegfried so much that he renounced his father.[1]Later, when he joined the Order, a rumor began to circulate in the Trade Quarter of Vizima claiming he was secretly a bastard of Jacques de Aldersberg.[3]Siegfried first met Geralt in the Vizima sewers while they were both on the hunt for a dangerous cockatrice. The knight suggested that they join forces to defeat the beast and deal with drowners. After the cockatrice was slain, both Geralt and Siegfried were ambushed on their way to the surface by Salamandra agents. After these were defeated, Siegfried sarcastically asked whether they were friends of the witcher's, then on a more sober note mentioned a friend who might be of service in defeating this organization: Raymond Maarloeve, a private detective living in the Temple Quarter just above the sewers.Siegfried then spent most of the following days at his post (if he and Geralt joined forces in the sewers, this is the Order outpost north of the Cloister; if not, it is at the front entrance to St. Lebioda's Hospital), at one point making a brief excursion to the swamp - but first, he waited by the gate to the dike in order to help Geralt past its guards. He could also be invited to Shani's party. Later on, he was moved before the Cloister's main entrance and advised Geralt on a couple of happenings.If Geralt has consistently supported the Order: Siegfried became a key ally to Geralt and started realizing that Jacques de Aldersberg is descending down a path of madness with mutated Greater brothers and other similar monstrosities designed to defeat both the Scoia'tael under Yaevinn and forces loyal to King Foltest.If Geralt has consistently supported the Scoia'tael: Siegfried became yet another fanatic who blindingly believed in words of the Grand Master and considered the witcher to be traitor, becoming his sworn enemy.[3]After the death of Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg, the Order de facto lost its ground in Temeria and parts of Aedirn. The Order's Supreme Council convened not long after and Siegfried was chosen as the next Grand Master.[2] The assembly also accepted King Radovid V's proposal to become a special force of Redania and moved to that kingdom's northern parts where they began to build Castle Barienmurg, the main stronghold of territories granted to them as well as one of the largest fortifications in the Northern Kingdoms.At this point, Siegfried still continued his monster hunting but due to an overload of work, he has done so sporadically. When summit of monarchs and mages was being prepared at Loc Muinne in July 1271, Radovid summoned Siegfried and his knights to oversee the security.Iorweth's path: Siegfried stepped in to allow Geralt safe passage into Loc Muinne through the Order's Camp, though Iorweth nevertheless had to find an alternate route.Roche's path: Siegfried vouched for both Geralt and Vernon Roche when entering Loc Muinne and meeting Radovid. Siegfried believed in Geralt's innocence regardless of the path the witcher has taken and also stated he owes Geralt too much to stand against him as well as talking about Radovid's ambition, the reformation of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and the Order's view on peasant rebellions.</td></tr><tr><td>130</td><td>Teyu</td><td>Vodyanoy</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Teyu was a renegade vodyanoy cleric.In summer 1270, Teyu and his warriors began to attack defenseless people of Murky Waters in nearby fields.

However, one night while they wandered the city, Shani noticed two spies following them and eventually the inept men accidentally revealed that Thaler was, in fact, the head of Temerian Intelligence, ending their short relationship.Eventually in 1270, Thaler began to pose as a fence in the city to gather intel and was visited by Coleman, who sold him some witcher equipment he'd found. Thaler eventually sold this off to the guards, not realizing it'd soon lead to him crossing paths with the witcher Geralt, who was also looking for the owner of the sword. During this time, King Foltest also left the city for a bit and personally put Thaler in charge while he was away.Shortly after, Geralt visited and, after Thaler revealed what he knew about Berengar, the two parted ways only to meet up again later during an important reception for high class society. However, this time Thaler was now using his real identity, Bernard, and revealed to Geralt who he really was. He eventually asked a favor for a favor and had Geralt retrieve a mysterious letter, not revealing he believed someone was forging documents as Foltest. With the newest letter in hand though he was finally able to confirm it, as the letter was supposedly from Foltest stripping Thaler of his position as chief but was missing the king's signature.As the party winded down, Thaler went outside but soon got into an argument with Roderick de Wett, and while the count remarked Thaler was just mad about being fired, Thaler noted de Wett knew more than he was letting on.If Geralt defends Thaler: Thanks to the witcher stepping in, Thaler was saved from being killed by de Wett and his men. He then asked Geralt to meet him back in the inn to talk and Thaler revealed all the evidence he'd gathered on the forged documents.If Geralt kills him or walks away: With no one else to protect him and outnumbered, Thaler was quickly killed. Game continuation: Note that this is one of the few times in the games where your choice has no effect and Thaler will appear alive in the third game, even if killed here and you imported saves all the way through.After Nilfgaard invaded Temeria in late 1271, they quickly dismantled the kingdom's secret service and Thaler barely escaped with his life. Not knowing what else to do, he proceeded to drink away his sorrows until his \"\"liver screamed bloody murder\"\" then decided he had to do something about the situation. Shortly thereafter he got into contact with Vernon Roche and Sigismund Dijkstra and the three decided something extremely drastic had to be done: King Radovid V of Redania had to die.Using his experience as Temeria's former spymaster</td></tr><tr><td>132</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NULL</td></tr><tr><td>133</td><td>Tobias Hoffman</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>\"Tobias Hoffman was the mayor and chief of the village of Murky Waters.

When their agent was endangered by the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who'd been hired to deal with the sylvan, she was among those who knocked out the witcher and the bard Dandelion and proceeded to tie them up.When the two woke up, Toruviel began to berate the bard and beat him before breaking his lute. Enraged at this, Geralt provoked Toruviel to come closer and, despite being tied up, managed to headbutt the elf, breaking her nose. With that, Toruviel made to kill the witcher but lost control and broke down crying while the other elves proceeded to bandage her nose.Later, after Dana M�adbh intervened and prevented Geralt and Dandelion's execution, the still-bandaged Toruviel gave Dandelion her own lute to replace the one she had destroyed.[1]When Scoia'tael units were formed to fight humans, Toruviel joined a commando together with Yaevinn and Cairbre aep Diared. In June 1267, while the three were on reconnaissance, she kicked Yaevinn to wake him up after Cairbre noticed a lone rider on the road from Tretogor to Aedirn. Though Toruviel tried to discourage her comrade, stating one lone human wasn't worth the effort, Yaevinn shot the commander, unaware that sparing his life would have prevented the provocation at Glevitzingen and the subsequent war.[2]Later, in early August, Toruviel and Ciaran aep Dearbh were wounded and guided by Milva to Col Serrai for healing. Not long after though, the two received news that Coinneach D� Reo's commando was recruiting new elves and went to join him despite Milva's objections.[3]Toruviel and Yaevinn took part in the Battle of Brenna as members of the Vrihedd Brigade under Isengrim Faoiltiarna. At one point in the battle Menno Coehoorn ordered Vrihedd to strike at the point where Redanians under Kobus de Ruyter stood near the Temerians.[4] Toruviel took part in the charge and was wounded in her arm by a 15 year old Redanian pikeman just before she cut his skull. She did not feel pain until the brigade breached the frontline and reached the tents and wagons.[5] There, Yaevinn broke into Rusty's tent, murdering the wounded until he saw a Nilfgaardian. Toruviel called to him to retreat after Blenheim Blenckert's reinforcements arrived.After the defeat at Brenna, a still wounded Toruviel and 7 other members of her commando fled.

It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.Not much is known about Triss' upbringing. Not even a precise time of her birth, which is a subject to some degree of confusion - see below. What is known is the fact, that she was born and lived as a child in Maribor. Sometime during her childhood, she had a conduit moment and was noticed by sorcerers. Thus, she found her way to Aretuza. Here, she became a sorceress on her own, specializing in making of magical potions, mainly healing ones. This was rather amusing twist of fate as she herself was alergic to magical potions and could only tolerate non magical ones.After the graduation, she became a very well known and respected sorceress taking her assignment as a advisor to the throne of Temeria.During her studies, she befriended a fellow sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg.

The witcher bought up his true purpose for visiting the city, to cure the curse of Adda the White. Velerad explained the curse and the reward for saving her, and then went with him to the new palace, where they met with Foltest, Segelin and Ostrit. After the king left, the four other men spent a while discussing the appearance and history of the striga, before the witcher left to prepare for his contract.Later, after Adda had been cured and Geralt was recovering in the palace, Velerad went and saw him, telling him about her transformation, though the witcher passed out mid-conversation due to exhaustion.In the game, Velerad enjoyed the distinction of being the burgomeister of Vizima. He could be found on the ground level of the guardhouse in the Trade Quarter after Gold Rush. The rumors flying around town suggested that he is ineffective in his role and spends most of his days drinking. Or perhaps this was simply the appearance he wishes to maintain.He was a confidant of Princess Adda and knew about most of the goings on around town, despite what the citizenry considered evidence to the contrary. Technically, Geralt could sneak out during the banquet and see him at the guardhouse as well.

By the 1260s, he was the sole old witcher remaining; however, as he was only a fencing instructor, he didn't possess the knowledge necessary to create new mutagens in order to mutate more disciples into witchers.[3]Considered among the oldest witchers remaining, Vesemir was born early enough to witness the construction of Kaer Morhen in the 11th century.[4] He was claimed by the Law of Surprise by a mysterious individual known as Deglan[5] and was brought to the Kaer Morhen valley to be trained as a witcher. His mentor and tutor was Barmin.[6]In the second half of the 12th century, Kaer Morhen was attacked by an enraged mob led by group of mages and priests.

After the duel, the two groups all went their separate ways.Tailles in the TV-series was faithful to his depiction in the books, in all the scenes taken from canon, following Falwick like a shadow. In addition, he was the one to tell his mentor about Shrike. Played by Rafal Mohr in The Hexer TV series.Arthur Tailles was a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.

She was a sister of Eviva, aunt of Mawr and Cinead var Anahid as well as grandaunt of Cahir Mawr Dyffryn aep Ceallach.Assire was a founding member of the Lodge of Sorceresses and remained a member along with Fringilla Vigo, also in service of the Empire. She took advantage of Carthia van Canten's relationship with the head of Nilfgaardian Secret Service, Vattier de Rideaux, and used it to spy on him.She was also known for helping Imperator Emhyr var Emreis with military operations during the war. Even though Assire was a Nilfgaardian sorceress, she and Eviva had Nordling blood. She also owned a black cat called Merlin.In 1267, Assire was contacted by Philippa Eilhart to join the creation of a new mage organization. At the risk of her own life, as doing such a thing was forbidden for Nilfgaardian mages, she attended the first meeting via teleportation. On first seeing her, the northern sorceresses were surprised by her unattractive appearance, since northern mages often used glamours while in Nilfgaard it was frowned upon, believing attractiveness was proof of a sorceress' superficial mindset. Assire, along with the other sorceresses, listened to Philippa's proposal to create the Lodge and at the end was asked to invite a second Nilfgaardian sorceress to the next meeting in a couple weeks.[1]Thus she met with fellow countrywoman and sorceress, Fringilla Vigo. Fringilla was surprised that Assire had changed her style, choosing to wear more fashionable attire, as they prepared to leave to meet with the other sorceresses. It was during the meeting with the Lodge, when they discussed Ciri, that Assire revealed that Emhyr did not have Ciri but an impostor.[1]In 1271, she teleported from Nilfgaard to Loc Muinne and met with ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. He presented her Triss Merigold who was under the spell of artefact compression. Assire decompressed Triss and then was immediately restrained and killed by Shilard and Renuald aep Matsen due to her affiliation with the Lodge.[2]Because of the hazy circumstance surrounding her death, many speculations rose in the Empire, fueling propaganda and political conflicts for several years.[2] At one point in Nilfgaard's history, images of sorceresses were destroyed very diligently and thoroughly leaving no relevant source of their appearance for future. In the 14th century, however, all of the Lodge's members were posthumously rehabilitated and given sainthood and martyrdom.[3]</td></tr><tr><td>172</td><td>Auckes</td><td>Human (Witcher)</td><td>Male</td><td>Witcher (formerly)Assassin</td><td> School of the Viper Kingslayers</td><td>\"Auckes (Polish: Egan) was a witcher of the School of the Viper and a member of the Kingslayers sent to the Northern Kingdoms by Imperator Emhyr var Emreis to wreak havoc. He, along with his brother and fellow witcher, Serrit, took part in both the process of Demavend III's murder on the Pontar and an attempt on Henselt's in the Kaedweni camp near Vergen. The latter was unsuccessful, however, and cost Auckes his life.After Geralt saved Letho's life in Angren, the witcher helped him find the Wild Hunt who had kidnapped Yennefer. Auckes and his brother Serrit formed part of the party of witchers that were tracking down the Wild Hunt.In the winter solstice of 1270, at an event that would come to be known as the night of magic, Auckes took part in the battle of the Hanged Man's Tree, where the witchers faced the riders of the Hunt. Although the witchers fought bravely, they could not kill them all due to being highly outnumbered. A stalemate was reached and after an exchange had taken place (Geralt for Yennefer), the riders took off and the remaining witchers left with Yennefer in tow.After her return, Yennefer was feverish, delirious, in agony, and suffering from amnesia. Out of respect for Geralt, the witchers took care of the sorceress until she was better. However, Yennefer turned out to be quite a handful, trying to seduce Auckes to drive a wedge between the witchers and causing the group endless trouble in Nilfgaard, a kingdom known to have strict rules on mages that could result in her being killed for her unruly behavior. To try and protect her, the group wandered through the provinces of the empire pulling Yennefer out of whatever trouble she would find herself in until one day they got caught by the imperial secret police.They were questioned separately, but no violence was used. After the interrogations, Letho received an offer from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself: kill as many northern kings as he could, and in recompense, the emperor would rebuild the School of the Viper; Letho agreed and recruited some of his fellow Vipers into the task, thus Auckes became part of a group that would be remembered as the Kingslayers.[1]Sometime after Letho managed to slay Demavend III, he met with Auckes in a nearby forest and gave him the former king of Aedirn's head. Auckes initially complained about the head's smell, weight, and size before Letho instructed him to give it to S�le de Tansarville to receive payment and further orders. Thanks to a deal Letho made with Iorveth, Auckes and his fellow kingslayers were temporarily allied with Scoia'tael, who provided them with protection in-between assassinations.[1]Auckes and Serrit in Geralt's visionLater, Auckes and his brother were tasked with assassinating Henselt, the king of Kaedwen. After making their way through the Kaedweni lands, the brothers made their hideout in a network of caves located near the Kaedweni camp and spent their time there, waiting and planning.On the day of the strike, they cleared some harpies outside the cave and proceeded to met with Letho. After a short conversation about the presence of Geralt in the Kaedweni camp and their next move, the witchers set out on their mission. They used the time they had in the walk towards the camp to discuss the events that were to go down at Loc Muinne.After infiltrating the camp, Auckes secured the ground floor by disposing of the guards, then proceeded to rendezvous with Serrit and together fought the knights that were defending the king. When they were ready to eliminate Henselt, however, Geralt showed up in defense of the king and the former companions clashed. After a hard fought battle, Auckes was cut down by Geralt.[1]After his death, the sorcerer Dethmold used Hanmarvyn's Blue Dream on Geralt - a necromantic ritual that allows one to experience the final moments of the dead through someone else's eyes. After seeing the witcher's recent past, Geralt learned of the location of the Kingslayers' hideout and S�le de Tansarville's involvement in the assassinations of the northern monarchs.[1]Auckes in a heat of battle, using two swordsAuckes seemed to be the less serious of the brothers, being sarcastic at times while being very confident of his skills. Serrit noted that Auckes was something of an optimist, although he was not reckless; more so than Serrit, Auckes realised the potential difficulty of his task and was uncomfortable with the idea of facing Geralt. Along with his brother, Auckes was fond of using bear traps.Auckes appeared to regard Geralt as a friend, which is reflected when he asked if Geralt wasn't hanged for Foltest murder and Letho asked him if he wanted to see him hanged, he lowered his head and just answered \"\"no\"\".

However, in Chapter IV, Geralt finds Berengar, still very much alive just outside of Murky Waters.Berengar and Geralt work together briefly, before Berengar explains why he left Kaer Morhen. He voices his disdain for the Witchers, whom he holds responsible for denying him a normal life. Later, on Black Tern Island, Berengar confronts Geralt with the intention of challenging him to a duel, forcing Geralt to choose once again, his next course of action.If he spares Berengar, then Geralt will have an ally to aid in the final battle with Azar Javed. If he duels with Berengar (as Geralt tells Berengar, just before the fight), only one can come out alive and Geralt prevails. This leaves Geralt with Berengar's remaining belongings, which include a powerful medallion, so powerful in fact, that Azar Javed cannot fail to notice it in the final battle.Note that when Azar Javed kills Berengar (if Geralt spared him earlier), the powerful medallion cannot be found on his corpse.It is actually possible to prevent Azar Javed from killing Berengar at the end of Chapter V, but nothing happens between Geralt and Berengar if this is the case.

However, it is not explained if the visions were about his Scoia'tael past or premonitions of the future like Jacques de Aldersberg (although Triss Merigold suggested the latter). Regardless, he usually spent most of his time drinking heavily trying to avoid having them--something that Geralt of Rivia admitted that he understood very well.In his quest to destroy the kayran, Geralt was pointed in the direction of Cedric, who helped him find the monster. Later, Cedric told the witcher where he could find some ostmurk in order to make the Mongoose potion. As a craftsman, Cedric sold various items, including formulae for weapon oil and potions (including for Mongoose), bombs, and the design for a kayran trap.Soon afterwards, Cedric helped to protect Triss when she was attacked by Letho. However, the kingslayer managed to fatally wound Cedric, so he fled into the forest. Cedric was eventually found by Geralt, who had followed a trail of the elf's blood.

She presented herself as a young adept and no one, not even Philippa, suspected her. While under cover she managed to capture Triss Merigold and compressed her into a small jade statuette which she gave to a messenger to send it to Shilard.While searching for Triss, Geralt learned from Shilard that Cynthia was actually a Nilfgaardian spy that was sent to infiltrate Saskia's rebels and spy on the Lodge of Sorceresses. Shilard presumed that he could tell Geralt since he would die soon after but he was mistaken.Geralt had not expected to run into Cynthia again, after all that happened, but he did.

He could be courteous and friendly, although he likely had ulterior motives for being nice. This could have also been a ploy to make himself appear as less of a threat to others. Despite his friendly projection, his appearance and attire have been known to terrify several people.[1]Later on, he revealed he was at least partially sadistic, delighting in the torture of prisoners and had brutally killed and mutilated victims with magic.

Dethmold was amoral and would do anything to gain power for himself and/or Kaedwen, including kidnapping Anais La Valette if Geralt did not join Iorveth in Chapter I.Dethmold had no scruples when it came to kidnapping, execution or other socially frowned upon actions. He had a non-existent morality - and this carried on to his advisee, Henselt of Kaedwen. He was however also loyal to not only Henselt but Kaedwen as a nation.As revealed during Chapter III on Roche's path, Dethmold was also homosexual. He was seen with his manservant who was also his sex slave (though it is not proven besides the words of the servant himself) while preening in front of a vanity, gently caressing his acne, warts and zits. There were a number of suggestive items scattered around his chambers in Loc Muinne. Dethmold also had an apprentice and a little commando for his safeguard.On Roche's path, depending on the circumstances, Dethmold could either slip through Geralt's grasp or he could be brutally killed by Roche. On Iorveth's path he would be executed on Saskia's orders.Comments about Dethmold from the CDPR developers Jan Bartkowicz (Story Writer), Artur Sliwinski, (Story Writer), Arkadiusz Borowik (Story Writer) and Jan Marek (Concept Artist) taken from the \"\"Dev Diary 3:\"</td></tr><tr><td>202</td><td>Dmitri</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Dmitri was a bandit and a murderer that Geralt met during Troll Trouble quest in Chapter I, at the cemetery of Lobinden, while he was talking with his men of their latest victims.

As its leader, he was known to most as the King of the Wild Hunt. Eredin was a high ranking general in his world until he killed the king and became his successor.Despite being a notable strong soldier who was also skilled in magic, not much was known about his younger years.When King Auberon Muircetach, ruler of the Aen Elle elves, created the Red Riders, he appointed Eredin as their leader and general. Eredin, who at the time could access the Gate of the Worlds, allowing him to travel to different worlds at will, used the Gate and led the Red Riders in raiding many different worlds. Their main objective was to find and secure a sufficient number of humanoid - preferably human - slaves, that could serve the elves. Over time, this made Eredin and his men infamous and feared and they began to use magic to make themselves look even more menacing, like skeleton shaped armor and altering their voices.As time went on, they eventually rediscovered their original homeworld: the Aen Seidhe world where, prior to the Conjunction of the Spheres, all elves were from. However, it was now controlled by humans and since the Aen Elle had a deep hatred towards the race, the Aen Seidhe world became their primary target with Eredin often leading raids on the world and stealing a great number of young individuals. People from that world quickly started to fear the riders and they gave them a new name - the Wild Hunt. Because Eredin always led his men personally, he was present almost all the time and, as the lead rider, he caused the most fear in the common folk and soon they started to call him the King of the Wild Hunt.An unknown time later, the unicorns freed themselves from the grasp of the Aen Elle and took the Gate from them, meaning Eredin could no longer use it. This also caused all the elves to be stuck in their world with no access to more slaves and so they began to study the magic of traveling to different realms. However, they were only partially successful and created navigators - specialized mages trained to open portals to different worlds, but they could only transport a small group of riders. Due to this, the riders used spectral forms in place of physical and traveled in the skies as a cavalcade of specters.Around 1267 the Wild Hunt sensed a certain individual with very powerful Elder blood who turned out to be a little girl named Cirilla. As Elder blood was crucial for regaining access to the Gate of the Worlds, Eredin set his sights on capturing her as he wanted to resume his invasions of other realms. The Wild Hunt first tried to catch her near the city of Gors Velen but this failed and his continued search for her proved fruitless. However, thanks to his fellow elf Avallac'h, who lured Ciri to the Aen Elle world and took her to the palace in Tir n� Lia, Eredin was finally able to confront her and the two elves gave her an ultimatum: either she lay with the king and give him a child that would reintroduce the Elder blood to the elves - thus possibly giving them access to the Gate again - or she would never leave the palace. Ciri eventually agreed and tried to fulfill her end of the bargain but Auberon was very old and hated humans, considering them little more than animals. Because of this, he was unable to perform and produce a child with Ciri. Eredin, sensing an opportunity, gave an aphrodisiac to his king that was actually a poison, killing Auberon. This, in turn, made Eredin the successor to the crown.With the king dead, chaos spread in the palace and Ciri, with the help of the unicorns, managed to escape not only the palace but the Aen Elle world altogether. Eredin pursued her with the Wild Hunt but she managed to evade them and so he returned to the palace empty handed.Once he returned, he proclaimed himself the new king, having made sure nobody knew about his role in Auberon's death. Only Avallac'h suspected Eredin, but he had no proof so he left the palace and went searching for Ciri on his own.Meanwhile, Eredin consolidated his power and made a few changes. Because he had no interest in the governing aspects that come with being a king, he appointed Ge'els to serve as his viceroy and take care of the state while he was leading the Wild Hunt. He also chose two elves as his most trusted generals - Caranthir as a chief navigator and Imlerith as a commander of the riders.He also haunted Ciri as a wraith while she rested in a French tavern, telling her that he would wait for her on The Spiral - a place he said she would eventually enter after her long journey through space and time.The Aen Elle world soon faced a new and dangerous threat known as the White Frost - a deadly phenomenon that caused an eternal winter, killing off everything that once inhabited the world, and was supposed to be the eventual end of every known world. Eredin decided the only way to escape the apocalypse would be to move the Aen Elle to the world of the Aen Seidhe and conquer it. However, his navigators lacked the power to move thousands of Aen Elle elves. Knowing Ciri's power would be able to create a large enough portal for his people, even if it were to kill her in the process, thus Eredin began to hunt for Ciri once more.This time however he tried something new. He knew that Ciri had loved ones so his new approach was to capture them and hopefully lure her into a trap while she attempted to save them. Thus he and his raiders went to Malus Island where Ciri's adoptive parents - Geralt of Rivia and Yennefer of Vengerberg - lived. Though Geralt managed to cut down many of the attackers, Eredin was able to kidnap the sorceress and took off with her. Geralt pursued him and was joined at one point by several witchers from the School of the Viper and, together, they caught up with the Hunt near the Hanged Man's tree in Nilfgaard and began to fight the Hunt. While the witchers proved to be capable fighters, they were too outnumbered, so Geralt offered to take Yennefer's place and Eredin agreed, releasing Yennefer.For some time, the witcher rode with the Wild Hunt and Eredin was satisfied as Geralt was an excellent lure for Ciri. As expected, she soon found out and in 1270 she managed to save Geralt from Eredin's grasp while not getting caught herself. Despite this, Eredin continued to haunt Geralt using his spectral form and eventually the two had a confrontation (with Eredin still in his spectral form) before he re-focused his efforts on Ciri, who by that point was being helped by Avallac'h.Eredin and the Hunt pursued the duo for over a year until one day the pair teleported to Ard Skellig. Sensing the power that came from such a teleportation, Eredin ambushed them in the forest and managed to inflict an extremely powerful Aen Undod curse upon Avallac'h that would slowly transformer the sage into a diminutive creature that humans would later call Uma. However, Avallac'h was not one to go down easily and cast a powerful spell that wrought havoc in the Hunt's ranks, destroying much of the forest, allowing the duo to escape, albeit ending up in different regions. Ciri ended up in Velen where she lost conscious and the Crones found her. However, the Crones served Eredin and when he was informed they had Ciri, he sent Imlerith to retrieve her. However, Ciri had managed to wake up and learn what the Crones had planned and escaped once more.Sometime later she returned to Skellige, this time to the village of Hindarsfjall, but not even a day later the Hunt attacked again. One of the locals, Skjall, helped her escape to where Avallac'h was waiting for her with Eredin and the Hunt hot on their heels, but the two made out into the water, leaving their pursuers on shore.With Ciri's location now unknown, Eredin waited for another chance Ciri might use her ability, giving her location away once more. Eventually Geralt, who learned Avallac'h had hidden her on the Isle of Mists, recovered her and the Hunt appeared, forcing Ciri to use her teleportation to transport her and Geralt to Kaer Morhen.Now knowing the location of Ciri, the Wild Hunt attacked the witcher keep in full force and Imlerith and Caranthir personally took part in the fight, but Eredin watched rather than join in himself. However, the witchers were able to put up a tougher fight than expected and Eredin called his generals away before blasting through into the courtyard with a powerful frost spell, freezing everyone caught in the blast, including Geralt.Ciri and Vesemir, who'd been shielded by a wall, were the only ones not affected and while the old witcher tried his best to get Ciri to safety, he was caught by Imlerith who began to beat him up when Eredin stopped him, realizing they could use his life as blackmail to get Ciri to go with them. Despite Vesemir's protests to not do it, Ciri started to walk unarmed towards Eredin so Vesemir stabbed Imlerith who angrily snapped the witcher's neck. Seeing the death of her old mentor, Ciri's grief and rage, mixed with her Elder blood, caused a burst of raw magical power, threatening to kill not just the Wild Hunt and Eredin, but all the witchers in the area as well. Eredin, driven by the need to capture Ciri regardless, tried in vain to get to her, but Caranthir opened a portal and teleported himself and the king away, ending the battle.In the days following Eredin's humiliating retreat, the Aen Elle king received a few devastating blows to his power base, starting with Imlerith being slain by Geralt at the Sabbath before the White Wolf and Avallac'h traveled to Tir n� Lia to show Ge'els via onieromancy of Eredin's regicide, which prompted the viceroy to refuse reinforcements should Eredin call for aid.Eventually, Eredin responded to a call from Ciri using the Sunstone, prompting him to redirect the Naglfar to the coast of Undvik. He soon found that it was in fact a trap, as the Wild Hunt was beset by both Nilfgaardians and Skelligers. On the deck of his ship, Eredin faced Crach an Craite and the elf proceeded to toy with the jarl, dealing him grievous wounds before asking if he had any final words. Crach refused and went in for one last attack, which Eredin cut down with ease, killing the jarl.He was then confronted by Geralt and Eredin proclaimed he had something to tell the witcher but would only reveal it as the witcher was dying. As they battled, Eredin opened various portals into other realms where the two continued to fight before returning back to the Naglfar and where Geralt proceeded to stab Eredin in his left eye before dealing a fatal blow. Dying, Eredin confessed that Avallac'h had manipulated both of them into this confrontation so he could use Ciri for his own purposes before succumbing to his wounds.Eredin Br�acc Glas is one of playable characters in MOBA \"\"The Witcher Battle Arena\"\" added with Season 3 Update and has a lot of interesting weapons</td></tr><tr><td>213</td><td>Eskel</td><td>Human (witcher)</td><td>Male</td><td>Witcher</td><td> School of the Wolf</td><td>\"Eskel was a witcher of the School of the Wolf taught by Master Vesemir at Kaer Morhen and active in the 13th century.

For many years, he engaged in an ongoing dispute with King Demavend III of Aedirn over the Lormark. Henselt was also the architect of a plan to exterminate all non-humans in areas bound by the Pontar, Gwenllech, and Buina rivers. He sported a classic beard and had small, penetrating eyes.Henselt spent a great deal of time, energy and money dealing with the Squirrels. He married a woman whose name is not known and she bore him one son who had married before ultimately dying in a hunting accident.His commissar was Vilfrid Wenck. After the war with Nilfgaard, he was one of the negotiators of the peace treaty.King Henselt stumbled ungainly on the dance floor and tripped over his tongue at courtly salons. On the battlefield, however, he moved as deftly as a fish in water. He knew all his infantryman by name and could recite the range of each and every catapult to the inch. Indeed, he adored his war machines. He would walk the ranks of his catapults like a proud father, tenderly stroking each ballista and trebuchet.

He defeated the commanders of many special forces of the North, including someone from the Order of the Flaming Rose, except for the Blue Stripes captain Vernon Roche. His other skills included playing the recorder.Even though he was always extremely proud of his race, Iorweth's clothes were a combination of elven and human clothing. He didn't acquire them all at once but rather stack it up with useful pieces from armors of humans he killed.[1]Iorweth and Isengrim Faoiltiarna were supposedly the only two who survived the massacre of the Vrihedd Brigade at the Ravine of the Hydra, following the peace of Cintra.Throughout the entirety of the Second Northern War, Iorweth was allied with the Nilfgaardian Empire and led a Scoia'tael commando with which he constantly caused trouble to rear of Northern Kingdoms' combined forces in the Pontar valley.One of the elves under his command was Echel Traighlethan who was captured by the Redanian Secret Service and brought to Drakenborg to be hanged.[2]When the peace of Cintra was signed between the North and Nilfgaardians on 2 April 1268, all of the Vrihedd Brigade officers and Scoia'tael leaders were rounded up to be executed in line with what was agreed at negotiations.[3]Iorweth somehow managed to escape and survive long enough to assemble a new commando from elves dissatisfied with the outcome of the war. One by one, Iorweth and his guerilla fighters defeated most of the Northern special forces with the major exception being the Blue Stripes of Temeria.Sometime around November 1270, Iorweth was approached by a mysterious individual claiming to be a friend of nonhumans with an offer: the man wanted to kill kings for his own inscrutable reasons and would like Iorweth's help in the form of the elf's knowledge of secret trails and weapon stashes. To back his claim, this man showed Iorweth the head of Demavend, King of Aedirn, Lord of Dol Blathanna and Sovereign of the Pontar Valley.Four months later, Geralt, Triss, and Vernon Roche met Iorweth. Roche quickly showed that he knew the elf and they were quite hostile to each other, hinting at less-than-pleasant past experiences. Shortly afterward, it became clear that Iorweth managed to rebuild the commandos he lost during the war, as elves attacked Geralt and company on his orders.He was pushed by circumstances to the very edge of society, painfully aware that the Scoia'tael have been used in the war with Nilfgaard and have been ruthlessly sacrificed during peace negotiations. He was also determined not to let that happen again. He enjoyed a fierce loyalty from his men. None of them would ever betray Iorweth and this speaks volumes in his favor. Indeed, he was a skilled commander and as cunning as a fox.Considered a mass murderer and terrorist, even by Saskia, he had nonetheless come to understand that the ways of the Scoia'tael are doomed to fail, hence the reason he did not join Yaevinn and instead chose to fight side by side with humans and dwarves led by Saskia to secure the foundation of an independent state in Upper Aedirn, with a capital in Vergen. A state with egalitarian laws between elves, humans and dwarves.No matter the outcome of the conflict, Iorweth had already left Aedirn by the spring of 1272. He took his Scoia'tael with him, departing for unknown reasons. Unfortunately, his departure significantly reduced Vergen's military capabilities.[4] Though it's not confirmed where he went to, he was alive and safe there at least the remainder of the year.[5]Chapter I:Chapter II:Chapter III:Iorveth's Gwent card artworkIn the final game, Iorveth and Isengrim are mentioned by their fellow Scoia'tael warriors, in a camp outside of Novigrad. These lines may perhaps be the remnants of the cut content. He also has a Gwent hero card.Marcin Momot later confirmed that Iorveth is alive and well but that he would not appear in the game.[5][8] On 4 July 2016 short comic strip named Where is Iorveth? was released.Iorveth was involved in the large Nilfgaardian centric subplot which centered around an outbreak of the Catriona plague. This quest line had its own set of writers and designers, and remnants of the quest line exist in the form of: An Eye for an Eye, Blood Ties, and Contract: Patrol Gone Missing.[9] This quest line was also the original implementation of the Hearts of Stone expansion, before it was cut and completely redone for the expansion pack.[10]Iorveth would have appeared in Velen searching for a cure for the Catriona plague which was ravaging Velen and most of the southern part of the Continent, including Mahakam. Geralt would have to form a sensitive alliance between Iorveth, Roche, Ves and Thaler in order to obtain this cure from a rogue Nilfgaardian scientist called Martin aka Hector Krafft Ebbing. This questline was also meant to explore the Nilfgaardian's impact on the area, showing that they were not always the most enlightened group of people, and would go to extreme lengths in the name of law and order.[11]A playable build of this quest line existed, and was cut very late into production due to allegedly not fitting in well with the rest of the game, and requiring too many resources to complete.[12]A model was worked on internally, and a render of his character was set to be included in the Prima Guide. The original plan would have involved Geralt meeting him in Novigrad, along with other Scoia'tael.He would have had a role in at least 6 quests: Pyres of Novigrad, Get Junior, sq305-Scoia'tael (which later became Woodland Beast), a cut side-quest called sq309-Investigation, The Battle of Kaer Morhen and Final Preparations.Not much is known about SQ309-Investigation, but it would have involved a scene with Iorveth hiding in a basement of a house in the non-human district. He would have been playing his flute, using the same song, Stella Splendens, from The Witcher 2. This quest would have also featured an Elven Portal, although it's not specified what it would have been used for.SQ305-Scoia'tael would have involved other Scoia'tael commanders, such as Isengrim Faoiltiarna, Vernossiel, Gronostaj and Yrlissa. This quest was significantly reworked, and made it into the game as Woodland Beast. Vernossiel made the cut, but none of the other characters did. This quest was also mentioned in the preliminary Prima Guide.At the beginning of Pyres of Novigrad, he would have helped Geralt find Triss, and they would have gone to her house together. This would have made a lot of sense depending on your choices in The Witcher 2, as Triss can save his life in the epilogue. He would also have had connections to the criminal underground, knowing both The King of Beggars and Cleaver. There are mentions of other dialogue scenes, between Roche, Iorveth and Geralt, at the docks in Novigrad. A bug report from an Alpha build states that the writers needed to fully explain the relationship dynamic between them, and why they wanted to kill each other, because of events in the past.He would have taken part in the Battle of Kaer Morhen. The dialogue scenes between Roche, Letho and Ves were originally meant to be between Roche, Letho and Iorveth.

His closest associates were Auckes and Serrit, also kingslayers and fellow witchers from the School of the Viper. Letho enlisted the help of Iorveth and the Scoia'tael to aid him in his plan to kill the kings of the Northern Kingdoms; to back his claim, the Viper showed Iorveth a head that belonged to Demavend III, the king of Aedirn, whom Letho had previously slain.In the forests of Angren on July 25, 1270, Letho was near death after being struck by a slyzard's tail but Geralt, a witcher from the School of the Wolf, found and saved him while chasing after the Wild Hunt to rescue Yennefer. As thanks for saving his life, Letho told Geralt where to find the Wild Hunt and, alongside his own companions, travelled with him to find the spectral riders. Eventually, the group caught up with the Wild Hunt on the Winter Solstice, by the Hanged Man's Tree in Nilfgaard. Despite their skill, the witchers couldn't defeat all the warriors and a stalemate ensued before Geralt offered himself in exchange for Yennefer.Feeling it'd be disrespectful to Geralt to just leave the sorceress somewhere, Letho and the witchers took care of her. However, she was in pain, suffering from amnesia and caused an endless source of trouble for the group, which, in the Nilfgaardian Empire, meant she was liable to get caught and killed. While the group traveled constantly to try and avoid attention, they were eventually detained and thrown in jail. However, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself later approached Letho and offered him a deal he couldn't refuse: sow chaos in the North by killing some of its rulers, lay the blame on the Lodge of Sorceresses, and the School of the Viper would be restored.King Esterad Thyssen of Kovir and Poviss was initially Letho's first target, but this never came to be as the kingslayers came into contact with S�le de Tansarville, who contracted Letho with assassinating King Demavend and helped to organise it. Thus, in 1271, Letho snuck onboard Demavend's ship out on the Pontar and, using a Northern Wind-based capsule, froze most of the ship and nearly everyone on board except a handful that were protected by Abelard's counter spell. However, this wasn't enough and all the guards fell to Letho's blade before he rounded on the king and killed him, then cut off his head for proof. Per de Tansarville's suggestion, Letho subsequently sought out Iorveth with the head in tow; yet, instead of merely using the Scoia'tael in order to lie low after the killing as S�le had envisaged, Letho also secured an alliance between the kingslayers and the Scoia'tael, whereby the latter would help Letho and his comrades to kill the kings of the North in whatever way they could.Because of the kingslayers' first attempt on King Foltest's life having failed due to Geralt being there at the time of the attack and the would-be assassin's death, Letho planned a second attempt on the Temerian monarch's life with Iorveth, while being out of S�le's or anyone else's reach. Aware of the imminent siege at La Valette Castle, Letho decided to pose as a monk guarding over the king's children - a disguise which he enacted by framing himself as a helpless monk being tortured and then killing the person who treated him to keep the secret. Foltest, after successfully taking over the castle, appeared with Geralt, now acting as a bodyguard, at which point the king asked for Geralt to give him and the children some space. With his back turned, Geralt heard the attack too late as Letho revealed himself just after he killed Foltest and fled out a window to escape with Scoia'tael assistance, leaving Geralt to be wrongly accused of regicide. Shortly after this assassination, Letho attempted to betray Iorveth by turning one of his lieutenants against him. However, the elf refused, so Letho killed his entire unit to cover his tracks and left Ciaran to be captured by Flotsam's guards.In an attempt to catch Letho, Geralt, who now knew that Letho had attempted to get rid of Iorveth, the elf to the kingslayer as a ruse to expose the latter's treachery. However, Iorveth and his Scoia'tael were attacked by the Blue Stripes, leaving Geralt and Letho to battle each other. Letho prevailed in the battle with Geralt, but once the Wolf was down, he spared him.

His reign became, along with witch hunts, one of the defining factors of the post-war period that followed the Peace of Cintra. Radovid was a polarizing figure: a brilliant strategist and a superb general by some, a paranoid madman by others. There were also many who took the middle view of his policies being harsh but justified.He inherited his titles and estates as the only son of King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore. His two older sisters were Dalimira and Milena. Even though his father died in 1267, Prince Radovid didn't succeed him immediately because he was only twelve at the time and for several years the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council under influential Duke Nitert and Count Sigismund Dijkstra, the then-spymaster of Redanian Secret Service.Radovid bore a deep aversion towards mages that stemmed from his father being secretly assassinated by an unknown elf at the behest of the sorceress advisor Philippa Eilhart,[N 3] who then pulled strings from behind his back, ruled in his name and dominated and demeaned him throughout his youth.Radovid was born in 1255 in Tretogor to the royal pair, King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore, as their third child. He grew up with two older sisters: Dalimira, informally known as Dalka, and Milena, who was known as Milka in a similar fashion. Dalka eventually dedicated her life to the priesthood after her failed engagement with King Foltest of Temeria, who instead chose to marry his own sister Adda, while Milka attended Aretuza to become a sorceress Millegarda.[2]When Prince Radovid was 9 years old he was formally engaged to Cirilla, Princess of Cintra, when she was 12. The engagement was formalized between his father and Queen Calanthe, Ciri's grandmother, but the king broke the engagement off after half a year without giving any explanation and Ciri and Radovid never even had a chance to talk to each other.[3]On the day of the outbreak of the Second Northern War with the Nilfgaardian Empire, his father had unexpectedly fallen victim to an elven assassin.[4] A fact unknown to practically anyone was that it was Philippa Eilhart, at the time fighting on Thanedd Island, who hired the elf in order to gain more direct rule. Redania fell into chaos, as usually happens in such circumstances, and Queen Hedwig was not in a state to control things.[N 3] The aristocracy started to organize itself into factions, attempting to tear some land out for each and every one of them. Several practically licked the boots of Nilfgaardian emissaries led by Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen and were ready to rule with Nilfgaardian blessing, only to be caught off guard and stopped by the famous Redanian Secret Service. There remained but a handful of those who were spared, those with important enough social status and armed might to maintain peace, like Duke Nitert.[4]Nitert was put in charge of the Regency Council appointed to save the realm from a total civil war and they managed to do so, by hanging everyone they deemed traitor in specially modified fortifications with internment camps - most infamous of which would be Drakenborg. Its members, however, overlooked their underage crown prince and none of the Northern Kingdoms' elites, not even Philippa who took it upon herself to raise him, expected him to grow into a firm monarch who would repay all humiliations he and his mother had suffered during the interregnum.A young but decisive, unrelenting King Radovid V's deed quickly earned him the epithet of \"\"the Stern\"\".[5]He began his reign by taking care of various nobles who ruled on their lands rather independently from Tretogor. He proved a capable political actor</td></tr><tr><td>280</td><td>Ravanen Kimbolt</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Ravanen Kimbolt (born c. 1206)[1] was a Temerian aristocrat who, along with Boussy and Ana�s La Valette, became chief claimant to the throne in Vizima after King Foltest's assassination in April 1271. An old style magnate, he commands loyal forces in numbers so large that only a few of his countrymen can match him, among them his rival, Count Linus Maravel. He separates those around him into the nobly born and common folk, paying little attention to the latter - unless he has temporary use for them. Proud and gruff, he considers political power his birthright and has no patience for those who stand in his way. After the torture of both Aryan and Maria Louisa La Valette failed, Ravanen ordered a band of mercenaries to ambush a caravan with the royal bastards. The mercenaries never showed because Maravel, unaware of Kimbolt's attempt, diverted it, accidentally killing Boussy in the process.

He was a true knight, the last of his breed and the hero of the previous war between Aedirn and Kaedwen, led by Vandergrift.During that war, King Henselt's troops crossed the Pontar the third day after the autumn equinox. Aedirn had good spies, so they were ready for them, and Seltkirk lined up his troops under the banners of Vengerberg, Aldersberg and Gulet along the hills. They decimated the Dun Banner and wreaked havoc among the Kaedwenis. Aedirnian hearts rose at the mere sight of his shining white armor.Vandergrift cut Seltkirk off from the rest of his army. The two met in the middle of the melee. It was a battle of titans. Seltkirk allegedly just looked at his enemies and bowed ever so slightly. In the end, the Visitor hacked Seltkirk and sliced the white knight from his head to his groin.

He, along with his brother and fellow witcher, Auckes, took part in the attempted assassination of King Henselt in the Kaedweni camp near Vergen. Even though he was unsuccessful, he was not killed by Geralt like his brother and managed to flee the scene, only to be later found and disposed of by S�le de Tansarville to cover the Lodge of Sorceresses' role in the regicides.After Geralt saved Letho's life in Angren, the witcher helped him find the Wild Hunt who had kidnapped Yennefer. Serrit and his brother Auckes formed part of the party of witchers that were tracking down the Wild Hunt.In the winter solstice of 1270, at an event that would come to be known as the night of magic, Serrit took part in the battle of the Hanged Man's Tree where the witchers faced the riders of the Hunt. Although the witchers fought bravely, they could not kill them all due to being highly outnumbered. A stalemate was reached and after an exchange had taken place (Geralt for Yennefer) the riders took off and the remaining witchers left with Yennefer in tow.After her return, Yennefer was feverish, delirious, in agony, and suffering from amnesia. Out of respect for Geralt, the witchers took care of her until she was better. However, Yennefer turned out to be quite a handful, trying to seduce Auckes to drive a wedge between the witchers and causing the group endless trouble in Nilfgaard, a kingdom known to have strict rules on mages that could result in her being killed for her unruly behavior. To try and protect her, the group wandered through the provinces of the empire pulling Yennefer out of whatever trouble she would find herself in until one day they got caught by the imperial secret police.They were questioned separately, but no violence was used. After the interrogations, Letho got an offer from Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself: kill as many northern kings as he could, and in recompense, the emperor would rebuild the School of the Viper; Letho agreed and recruited some of his fellow Vipers into the task, thus creating a group that would be remembered as the Kingslayers. Like his comrades, Serrit was initially affiliated with Iorveth's band of Scoia'tael and received sanctuary from them in-between assassinations.[1]Serrit was a formidable swordsman, preferring to use two short blades in combatLater, Serrit and his brother were tasked with assassinating Henselt, the king of Kaedwen. After making their way through the Kaedweni lands, the brothers made their hideout in a network of caves located near the Kaedweni camp and spent their time there, waiting and planning.The day of the strike they cleared some harpies outside the cave and proceeded to met with Letho. After a short conversation about the presence of Geralt in the Kaedweni camp and their next move, the witchers set out on their mission. They used the time they had in the walk towards the camp to discuss the events that were to go down at Loc Muinne.After infiltrating the Kaedweni camp, Serrit secured the palisade while his brother took care of the ground floor. The witchers met by the cave entrance and once there they killed the knights protecting the king. Serrit then came into Henselt's tent and slit the throat of the messenger there, only to be confronted by Geralt; unfazed, Serrit attacked, but failed as Geralt used the sign of Aard to expel him from the tent. Auckes joined Serrit, resulting the witchers being forced to fight their former companion. While Auckes was cut down by Geralt, Serrit decided to flee after narrowly avoiding attacks from S�le's magic and successfully escaped to the hideout.[1]Serrit before dyingAlas it was to no avail, for S�le tracked him down to deliver him a painful death in an attempt to cover up the Lodge of Sorceresses' hand in the regicides. Geralt, who was on the kingslayer's trail, managed to find the Viper clinging on to life. With his dying breath, Serrit confirmed Geralt's suspicions about S�le's involvement, offered an apology for leaving him behind at the Hanged Man's Tree and began to discuss how close they got to vanquishing the Wild Hunt and freeing the world from the omen of war. The witcher succumbed to his wounds shortly after.[1]Serrit was a lot more hot-headed than his brother, complaining about the lack of action they had in the past days and being anxious to assassinate Henselt, claiming it would be an easy target due to his recklessness. He also didn't seem too troubled by the fact that the king also had a sorcerer and a witcher in his retinue, despite the latter being Geralt. Pragmatic as his brother, he cared little about the life of Triss Merigold and S�le and advised that they should be killed to prevent them from revealing their plan.He seemed to held Geralt in high regard, thinking of him as a skilled fighter, a friend and a man who could teach him about life in general, this is reflected in the Notes of the kingslayer named Serrit. He also shared an affection for bear traps with his brother. According to a Scoia'tael prisoner in the Kaedweni camp, Serrit was very proficient in Elder Speech, much more so than Geralt.</td></tr><tr><td>295</td><td>Seuxen</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>Soldier</td><td> Foltest</td><td>Seuxen is a Temerian noble who leads some of the men during the siege of La Valette Castle.

He was known for his sophisticated use of language which was considered comprehensible only to other diplomats and scholars.Because of his extensive contacts with the intelligence community, he was accused of being a Nilfgaardian spy, pronounced persona non grata in Redania and dismissed from office by Dijkstra. Despite the prior accusations of spying, he was sent by the emperor Emhyr to conduct peace negotiations with the monarchs of the North leading to the Peace of Cintra.Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen is a main character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. Geralt meets him while he is talking to King Foltest, in the Camp of Foltest's army during the Prologue. The ambassador does not reveal why he is there or what his intentions are. Throughout the story, Geralt crosses Shilard's path many times, finding out how this sly diplomat is involved in the political changes of the Northern Kingdoms and in the murders of kings.If Geralt chooses to rescue Triss from the Nilfgaardians in Loc Muinne, he takes Shilard hostage. When they come before a company of soldiers, their leader points a crossbow on Shilard, revealing that he was ordered by the capital to execute him, before following through and killing the ambassador.If Geralt doesn't rescue Triss, Shilard attends the summit, where he uses Letho to frame the Lodge of Sorceresses for the regicides.Comments about Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen from the CDPR developers Jan Bartkowicz (Story Writer), Artur Sliwinski, (Story Writer), Arkadiusz Borowik (Story Writer) and Jan Marek (Concept Artist) taken from the \"\"Dev Diary 3:In the third and final installment of the trilogy</td></tr><tr><td>300</td><td>Siegfried of Denesle</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>Knight</td><td> Order of the Flaming Rose</td><td>Siegfried of Denesle was the 2nd Grand Master of the Order of the Flaming Rose, serving from September 1270 to 1272.[2]As a young knight, Siegfried joined the brotherhood to fight against monsters and generally anything evil that might endanger the common folk. Since he was also a nobleman of some moral code and kind heart, Siegfried got along rather well with the witcher Geralt of Rivia and their friendship changed his life forever.Siegfried was born sometime in the 1250s to pious Sir Eyck of Denesle and his wife Sophia.[1] His parents raised him at Castle Denesle, teaching him knightly code of honor.At one point, a serious illness struck Siegfried's mother. He immediately ran to his father and implored him to earn coin for her betterment by demanding payment for next few beasts he would slay. Eyck, however, refused so as to not stain his reputation. This angered Siegfried so much that he renounced his father.[1]Later, when he joined the Order, a rumor began to circulate in the Trade Quarter of Vizima claiming he was secretly a bastard of Jacques de Aldersberg.[3]Siegfried first met Geralt in the Vizima sewers while they were both on the hunt for a dangerous cockatrice. The knight suggested that they join forces to defeat the beast and deal with drowners. After the cockatrice was slain, both Geralt and Siegfried were ambushed on their way to the surface by Salamandra agents. After these were defeated, Siegfried sarcastically asked whether they were friends of the witcher's, then on a more sober note mentioned a friend who might be of service in defeating this organization: Raymond Maarloeve, a private detective living in the Temple Quarter just above the sewers.Siegfried then spent most of the following days at his post (if he and Geralt joined forces in the sewers, this is the Order outpost north of the Cloister; if not, it is at the front entrance to St. Lebioda's Hospital), at one point making a brief excursion to the swamp - but first, he waited by the gate to the dike in order to help Geralt past its guards. He could also be invited to Shani's party. Later on, he was moved before the Cloister's main entrance and advised Geralt on a couple of happenings.If Geralt has consistently supported the Order: Siegfried became a key ally to Geralt and started realizing that Jacques de Aldersberg is descending down a path of madness with mutated Greater brothers and other similar monstrosities designed to defeat both the Scoia'tael under Yaevinn and forces loyal to King Foltest.If Geralt has consistently supported the Scoia'tael: Siegfried became yet another fanatic who blindingly believed in words of the Grand Master and considered the witcher to be traitor, becoming his sworn enemy.[3]After the death of Grand Master Jacques de Aldersberg, the Order de facto lost its ground in Temeria and parts of Aedirn. The Order's Supreme Council convened not long after and Siegfried was chosen as the next Grand Master.[2] The assembly also accepted King Radovid V's proposal to become a special force of Redania and moved to that kingdom's northern parts where they began to build Castle Barienmurg, the main stronghold of territories granted to them as well as one of the largest fortifications in the Northern Kingdoms.At this point, Siegfried still continued his monster hunting but due to an overload of work, he has done so sporadically. When summit of monarchs and mages was being prepared at Loc Muinne in July 1271, Radovid summoned Siegfried and his knights to oversee the security.Iorweth's path: Siegfried stepped in to allow Geralt safe passage into Loc Muinne through the Order's Camp, though Iorweth nevertheless had to find an alternate route.Roche's path: Siegfried vouched for both Geralt and Vernon Roche when entering Loc Muinne and meeting Radovid. Siegfried believed in Geralt's innocence regardless of the path the witcher has taken and also stated he owes Geralt too much to stand against him as well as talking about Radovid's ambition, the reformation of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers and the Order's view on peasant rebellions.</td></tr><tr><td>301</td><td>Silas</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>Soldier</td><td> Blue Stripes</td><td>As a member of the Blue Stripes, he took part in the attack on La Valette Castle.</td></tr><tr><td>302</td><td>Silgrat</td><td>Human</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Fandom may earn an affiliate commission on sales made from links on this page.</td></tr><tr><td>303</td><td>Skalen Burdon</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>For Death Symbolized, Geralt must beat Skalen at poker to retrieve Sabrina's spear.</td></tr><tr><td>304</td><td>Spark</td><td>Elf (Aen Seidhe)</td><td>Female</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Spark was an elven merchant who lived in Vergen, on Rhundurin Square, who sold food items.

To demonstrate what a good monarch he could be, Stennis and a few noblemen loyal to him joined Saskia in Vergen.If Geralt joins Roche: Unfortunately for him, his plan to ascend the throne of Aedirn came to a miserable end: when he, King Henselt and Saskia met to discuss on the future of Aedirn, a mysterious curse casted by Sabrina Glevissig many years before made all the corpses of Kaedweni and Aedirnian soldiers died in battle resurrect as wraiths, who soon started fighting against each other. Prince Stennis remained killed while trying to escape.If Geralt accuses Stennis to be guilty: After the poisoning of Saskia, Stennis was considered by the inhabitants of Vergen the only suspect. In the end, his speech didn't convince the witcher Geralt of his innocence; the Prince ended up lynched by peasants in front of his own chambers.If Geralt spares him from the mob: After the defeat of Kaedwenian Army, both the serfs and nobility deemed the Prince worthy of the crown and he returned to Vengerberg. Ascending to the throne as King Stennis I, he changed his ways and became sensitive to the hardship of his subjects. This won him the hearts of people who saw him as the hope of the nation.

It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.Not much is known about Triss' upbringing.

Sometime during her childhood, she had a conduit moment and was noticed by sorcerers. Thus, she found her way to Aretuza. Here, she became a sorceress on her own, specializing in making of magical potions, mainly healing ones.

The village elder of Lobinden asks that Geralt attempt to reason with the being, rather than simply kill it. When it is confronted underneath its bridge, the troll attacks Geralt in a drunken rage. After it is wounded, it pleads for mercy. Geralt has the option of killing it, or hearing it out.If it is allowed to explain its behaviour, it says that it drinks in order to forget the memory of its mate, who disappeared recently. Geralt can offer to find out what happened to her in exchange for repair of the bridge. After asking around town Geralt finds the unfortunate she-troll's head afixed to Lobinden's tanner's wall.

Cautiously trying to look around the ship, the frozen parts began to shatter and the witcher ran towards them. Tybalt, being the closest to Letho, began to fire off arrows, but the first missed, instead shattering one of the frozen crew members. As he fired off a second, Letho deftly avoided it by spinning and the arrow grazed his back instead. Before Tybalt could fire again, Letho stabbed him in the gut, killing him.The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings - Intro</td></tr><tr><td>319</td><td>Vandergrift</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>Soldier Rank(s) General</td><td> King Henselt of Kaedwen Kaedweni Army</td><td>\"Vandergrift, also known as the Visitor, was the general of the Kaedweni forces in the second war between Kaedwen and Aedirn.During that war, King Henselt's troops, including the dreaded Dun Banner, crossed the Pontar the third day after the autumn equinox.

He was the leader of a group of six dwarves and later a veteran of the Battle of Brenna.Not much is known about Yarpen's youth. It is known however, that he became a leader of his dwarven company which included Lucas Corto, Paulie Dahlberg, Regan Dahlberg, Xavier Moran, and Yannick Brass. This group traveled the Continent and hunted large and dangerous game.During that time, Yarpen and his company had apparently slain a dragon called Ocvist. Soon afterwards they traveled to Caingorn, where another dragon had been sighted and a hunt called. When they arrived in the kingdom, they joined the hunting party.Yarpen's group was just one of many parties participating in the hunt. Officially, the hunt was under the command of King Niedamir, but he did not really command anything. Other individuals joining the hunt were Knight Eyck of Denesle, Boholt and his Crinfrid Reavers, sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, witcher Geralt of Rivia, bard Dandelion, sorcerer Dorregaray, and last but not least, Knight Borch Three Jackdaws with his company of two Zerrikanian women (T�a and V�a). The target of the hunt was a large, female Green dragon that made a nest in the area. Shortly before the hunt commenced, the dragon was poisoned by some locals, and though seriously wounded, she survived.Thus the hunt begun. Very soon, Yarpen made a deal with Boholt about the dragon, the killing and mainly the share of the dragon's treasure. During the hunt, they encountered many perils such as a rock slide that almost killed the sorceress and the witcher but the two were saved by Eyck. They eventually reached their goal and stood face to face with the wounded dragon, but before they could attack another dragon appeared, this time a Golden dragon. Villentretenmerth, the dragon, used his telepathy and told the party he would fight them in a fair duel. Eyck of Denesle did not hesitate and swiftly attackeded but the dragon quickly defeated his foe and sent him, along with his horse, flying across the valley.After this, the King Niedamir decided to leave. However, the Reavers and Yarpen's group agreed they would still finish the hunt and kill the golden dragon. The hunting party argued, for Geralt, Dandelion, and Dorregaray did not want to kill such a beast and were against it. Boholt and Yarpen, along with their men, quickly defeated and bound all those who opposed them. The sorceress Yennefer, who at first appeared to side with the hunters, tried to use some spells against the hunters but was knocked off by Yarpen and tied up as well. With all the opposition tied up, Yarpen's and Boholt's men attacked the dragon.Though the golden dragon defeated them as well, the local militia arrived during the fight and attacked. The combined forces of all the men proved too much for the dragon and he began to lose. Fortunately, Yennefer, Geralt, Dandelion, and Dorregaray managed to free themselves and tried to defend the golden dragon. Likewise, T�a and V�a appeared and started to kill one man after another. Eventually, the defenders repelled the attackers and Villentretenmerth emerged victorious. He however forbade any more killing and thus the Reavers and Yarpen's group survived.

She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Supreme Council of Sorcerers within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.At some point, due to her magical potential, she was received in the Aretuza school for sorceresses, where rectoress Tissaia de Vries became her teacher and mother figure. During her training, Yennefer tried to kill herself by cutting both of her wrists, severing her tendons, though she survived. Tissaia claimed that the purposefulness of her attempt was the only thing that prevented her from feeling contempt for her weakness, and continued her training. In accordance with the sorceresses' tradition, any physical flaw, including her hunchback, was magically removed. Yennefer eventually graduated as a sorceress.[4]At some point, Yennefer set herself up in the town of Rinde and, ignoring King Heribert's rules that no magic users could stay in Redania, openly practiced her magic and provided her magical services to clients by staying with Novigrad's ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus granting her asylum from the law while in the ambassador's home. One morning, a witcher intruded on her sleep, revealing himself as Geralt of Rivia and that he needed her assistance in healing his friend, Dandelion, who had been afflicted by a djinn. After an initially rough greeting where Geralt responded sarcastically to her questions, Yennefer agreed to heal the bard, but she secretly made preparations in hopes of capturing the djinn, after Dandelion makes his final wish. When Geralt tried to stop her from using Dandelion, her spell took hold of the witcher, charming him to do her will against those on the town council who were against her. After Geralt is arrested, she has Dandelion, now awakened teleported out into town with instructions to make his wish to free Geralt. Yennefer tried to capture the djinn, but it fought her, destroying a good part of Rinde in the struggle, not knowing that the djinn's master was not Dandelion, but in fact, Geralt, who still held one wish. Geralt arrived to see Yennefer struggle with her spell, and he tried to stop her, leading them to fight one another. She got the better of him, and he revealed to her that he was the one with the last wish that could free the djinn. Geralt knew that the moment he made a wish, Yennefer would be too weak to contain the djinn and it would kill her. So Geralt saved their lives, by wishing their fates were tied together. Yennefer was grateful to the witcher, willing to bind himself to her, and the two began a relationship. TBAYennefer traveled to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander and spoke to Nenneke about a cure for her infertility. While she was at the temple, she spent time looking around for Geralt, and after discovering he wasn't there confronted Nenneke and ended up quarrelling with her, before leaving the temple.During the Battle of Sodden Hill she was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was later magically restored but she still bore the emotional scars.In May 1272, Yennefer sent Geralt a letter, arranging to meet in the village of Willoughby. However the village had been burned down, due to the Third Northern War reaching the region, so she headed through to the Nilfgaardian Garrison, passing through White Orchard in quite a rush. From the garrison, she headed to Vizima, meeting with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, concerning the location of Ciri. After a while, she heard Geralt was in White Orchard looking for her, so the sorceress rode with a Nilfgaardian escort to the White Orchard inn where she found Geralt and Vesemir. The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though she was nearly a century old. Yennefer had locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hung a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.Yen had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes she wasn't tall, was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs.She always dressed in black and white, at times wore stockings, wore frilled panties but never wore trivialities with underwire, she didn't need to. Her voice was resonant and mildly derisive. Her overall feminine shape was one of a twenty-year-old girl and she moved with a natural, unforced grace. She was a quarter-elf (meaning she had a quarter elven blood, in her case on her mother's side).It is implied that her attractive looks were a product of magic and had been acquired during her training, as with most other sorceresses. Geralt notes how her shoulders are slightly lopsided and by the end of the story realizes that Yennefer used to be a hunchback. Nevertheless, his love for her does not diminish.[6]Official The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt promo artwork by Marek MadejYennefer does not appear in the first game.

Lucky thing, since he has far fewer after the Common Cause Mine failed.Zoltan is the one to acquaint Geralt with dice poker, and to give him a couple of pointers about whom to challenge. After the initial meeting, he can be found in the Inn for the remainder of Chapter I.Later in the game, Zoltan can be found wandering around the Temple Quarter (roughly from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) and, if choosing to side with the Scoia'tael or take the neutral path, in the Old Vizima. He also often spends time with Golan Vivaldi.

Using his prior knowledge of herbs, Faria faked his own death by consuming a mixture of sleeping mushrooms, which he found growing on the walls of his cell, and belladonna, which he harvested in the prison yard. Despite the fact that this mixture was indeed life-threateningly toxic, Faria drank it one day anyway, an hour before the guards' evening rounds, given that, as he later stated in retrospect, he preferred to die on his own terms were that to be his fate.After his seemingly-dead body was discovered, Faria was thrown into a pit, as was the prison's procedure for handling cadavers at the time. Once he awakened, he used an outlet that lead into the river to escape. This prompted the prison's management to bar that outlet with a grate, in order to prevent any further escapes. The procedure for handling dead bodies at the prison was also altered; the bodies were began to be cremated, instead of being thrown into a pit.In 1272, Faria returned to Novigrad, where he was approached by Geralt of Rivia and Yennefer at the Crippled Kate's brothel.

As such, if Geralt helped the pellar with the Forefathers' Eve ritual, his spirit returned, claiming the pellar knows who he is and that he committed patricide.

Once he'd recovered, he immediately asked her to marry him and the couple appeared to be happy and soon welcomed a baby girl, Tamara. Shortly after she was born though, Phillip was sent to Cidaris to fight in another war, this time to aid King Ethain on King Foltest's behalf. As he was seldom home, Phillip turned to drinking and soon become so dependent on it, he couldn't stop drinking even when he was home. Anna, either due to loneliness or not able to put up with her husband's drinking or a combination of both, soon turned to a childhood friend, Evan, for comfort and for about 3 years had an affair with him while Phillip was away.Eventually, Anna decided it was best to leave Phillip completely and one day packed up and took Tamara with her to Evan's, leaving a note behind for Phillip to let him know she was leaving. Upset, Phillip followed her to bring her and Tamara back. However, still enraged, Phillip ended up killing Evan, upsetting Anna, who proceeded to yell and claw at him before picking up a knife and trying to stab him. Phillip moved out of the way just in time and, not knowing what else to do, beat her. This event marked the change in their relationship to an abusive one.Later, during the Third Northern War, Phillip moved the family to Crow's Perch where Anna made a small garden to tend to, and while Phillip tried to put on the air of a happy family, abuse still went on and by 1272 Anna was pregnant again. Extremely desperate to not have another child with the man she hated, she made a pact with the Crones where she'd be in their service for a year if they would do away with the unborn baby. However, ever deceitful, the Crones twisted it so while the fetus would die, it was also sapping Anna of her strength and killing her as well. In turn, Anna went to The Pellar for help, who gave her a strong talisman to ward off the Crones' evil magic.Wanting to get far away from Phillip and Velen, at one point Anna and Tamara (now a teen) secretly started planning an escape and enlisted the help of Voytek. Soon after Phillip, drunk once more, flew into a particularly mad rage and fought with Anna before passing out. Anna ended up miscarrying right there but she and Tamara decided that was their best chance to run and quickly ran to meet up with Voytek. However, in their haste, Anna didn't realize she'd dropped her talisman during the fight, her only protection against the Crones. As the two women rode for the fisherman's home, the Crones sent a fiend after Anna, grabbing her and carrying her back into Crookback Bog.The Crones soon put Anna's pact to use, having her take care of the orphans at the bog. However, due to a combination of the Crones magic and the stress of all that'd happened the night she miscarried, Anna's mind became addled and her hair went white, though she was sane enough to take good care of the children, who only knew her as Gran. At one point Johnny, a godling living in the area, also befriended her and the children and would drop in time to time and sing to her.Sometime later that year, Geralt dropped by in his search for Ciri, but not trusting strangers, Anna tried to get him to leave. However Johnny, as a favor to the witcher, dropped in and was able to convince her to help Geralt and so she went and arranged a meeting of sorts, where the Crones spoke through her, informing Geralt to go help Downwarren's ealdorman and then they'd help him out.If Geralt did Return to Crookback Bog: </td></tr><tr><td>355</td><td>Anselm</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Anselm was a merchant working in conjunction with his business partner Griswold.In 1272, Anselm, along with Griswold, his business partner, traveled to Velen from an unspecified place to trade with Phillip Strenger, the Bloody Baron, having deemed the venture worthwhile due to the lack of competition in the area.

In his usual style, he began the trip intoxicated.On its approach into Kaer Trolde Harbor, the Atropos was boarded by pirates of Clan an Craite.

Vattier merely saw her as beautiful and pleasurable when it came to sex and liked that she barely spoke, mistaking this for her being not so bright. Unbeknownst to Vattier, she was actually very intelligent with a remarkable memory and everything he told her about his intentions, she passed to Assire var Anahid.[2]The following year, when information from Vattier was no longer needed by Assire, Carthia left him - suddenly and unexpectedly, without giving any argument or explanation.[3]At one point in 1275, when Prince Ans�is of Lyria and Rivia, Queen Meve's son, was in Beauclair because of a knightly tournament that would come to pass, Carthia received a mission from Fringilla Vigo to allure him.

Not knowing why a witcher was in the city, Chappelle took the witcher aside under the pretext of asking how much he could be bought to deal with the supposed doppler running around in his city and Geralt informed him there was no price because he refused to hunt and kill in a city due to possible innocent bystanders and that he didn't view dopplers as a threat. Chappelle appeared to be annoyed at this and threatened that he'd have to force the witcher to do it if Geralt and his friends wanted to leave the city, before walking off with his armed men. From this conversation though, the doppler learned what he needed: that Geralt wasn't there to hunt him down.Later that day, Geralt caught up to Dudu and was on the verge of letting him walk off when Dudu, having taken on Dandelion's appearance, was unexpectedly knocked out by one of Dandelion's angry exes and began to change to his natural form. Geralt quickly covered him up when the group was approached by Chappelle once more. Afraid for Dudu's life, they tried to say he was just sick but Chappelle approached the rolled up material that the doppler was in and proceeded to address Dudu by his name and told him to change back to Dainty's form, the idea being \"\"all halflings look alike\"\" to everyone.

After King Bran passed the throne to Eist Tuirseach, Crach became Jarl of Skellige, the main commander of the military forces. He also had a brief affair with Yennefer and remained fond of her afterward, which he demonstrated by helping her in her search for Vilgefortz in 1267.He was known for sometimes showing his fiery temper as well as a healthy appetite. During his youth, he was described as a broad shouldered man with a mop of red hair. Later when he was a grown adult, his eyes were said to be hawk-like.Crach was born in early 13th century on Skellige to the clan of an Craite. His mother was from the clan of Tuirseach. Not much is known about his childhood, only that he was taken by Eist Tuirseach, his uncle, as his pupil, and young Crach learned many things from him. When he was a young man he met the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg and the duo had a short affair. Even though they separated Crach remained fond of the sorceress for the rest of his life. Some time after their split Crach met a woman that eventually became one of his wives. This woman gave him a son, his first born, Hjalmar. Crach, now a father and married man, lived happily in the typical Skellige style. A little over 2 years later, he was part of the Skellige envoy sent to the kingdom of Cintra where he was one of the contestants for the hand of Princess Pavetta.Queen Calanthe of Cintra invited many noble guests to the courtship of her daughter Pavetta, who just turned 15 and thus was ready for marriage. One of the main groups invited were those from Skellige. Above all, the queen wanted Pavetta to marry a Skelliger to ensure peace with the islanders. Among those sent from the islands were Crach an Craite, Eist Tuirseach, druid Mousesack and skald Draig Bon-Dhu. There were also other contestants, after all, the princess was a very beautiful young lady. Apart from the Skellige party, there were lords such as baron Eylembert of Tigg also known as Coodcoodak, prince Windhalm of Attre, and all three sons of Lord Strept. There was however another guest who did not appear to be interested in the hand of the princess. The honorable Lord Ravix of Fourhorn. Unknown to most of guests, Ravix was in fact just an alias of the witcher Geralt of Rivia who was personally invited by the queen and who sat next to her for the entire feast.The queen thanked all the guests and offered them an incredibly rich feast. Crach, as is common amongst his people, rebelled and drank like a true Skelliger. After some time, the princess appeared and joined the feast. She however, was not very happy and barely looked up. Thus the feast continued quite normally until a commotion occurred in the throne room, and an uninvited guest appeared. It was a knight in full plate armor who introduced himself as Urcheon of Erlenwald. He stood before the queen and told her about his past. He told her that 15 years ago, he saved King Roegner, husband of Calanthe, and invoked the Law of Surprise. That law granted him the child of the king - Princess Pavetta.To the great shock of all the guests, the queen admitted, that what the knight says is true yet she has no intentions to give him his daughter. Instead, she tricked him into removing his helmet. As he did, he revealed, that he was no man at all but rather some hedgehog-like creature, covered in spines with a muzzle full of fangs. Triumphant, the queen said that the Law of Surprise stands yet the princess has to agree to go with him. Calanthe was sure that seeing that he is a monster, Pavetta will reject him immediately. That however did not happened and to great surprise - and horror - Pavetta agreed to go with the monstrous knight. Calanthe collapsed to her chair, and the fight erupted. Cintrian knights as well as suitors attacked the Urcheon and pinned him to the ground. That was however a grave mistake. Pavetta, seeing Urcheon knocked to the ground, burst into an explosion of raw Power. That eruption was extremely dangerous and threatened everyone's life. The storm created by her was so strong, that nobody was able to move properly.The witcher Geralt, and druid Mousesack were eventually able to calm the princess and stop the eruption. When the situation calmed down, the princess explained, that she and the Urcheon, whose name is Duny, were secretly seeing each other for over a year and that they fell in love. Duny was in fact human but suffered a curse that turned him into a monster, though after midnight he recovered his human form. Calanthe had no choice but to agree with their union. This decision was very difficult because of her fear of Skellige. Eist however took this chance, and proposed to the queen. Surprised, the queen eventually agreed to marry him thus fulfilling her desire for a union between Cintra and Skellige. Duny thanked the witcher and promised him anything. As is common amongst witchers, he invoked the Law of Surprise because he did not wish anything from the young couple. To a great surprise, Pavetta admitted, she was with child, a child which now belongs to the witcher.[3]Crach returned from Cintra empty handed but his loss was not that great as he already had at least one wife and a son, Hjalmar, back home. He eventually ascended to the title of Jarl of the an Craite clan and the ruler of Kaer Trolde. When his uncle and mentor Eist married Queen Calanthe, he became her and Pavetta's relative and Ciri, Pavetta's daughter, spent her summers and winters visiting Skellige. However, after Pavetta and Duny died during their trip, Calanthe, angry at Crach and Eist for letting the young couple sail out, had Crach swear a blood oath (bloedgeas) that he would always guard Ciri and give any help needed when called upon in regards to her safety, before the queen banned Ciri from visiting the isles again. However, this ban only lasted 6 months and Ciri was once more spending her summers and winters on the islands. On one such occasion, Hjalmar, now 15 years old, was challenging anyone to beat him at an ice skating game where they tried to see how many rocks in a row one could jump over while ice skating. Ciri took him up on this and beat his record. When Hjalmar then tried to beat the new record, he instead broke several bones and was bedridden for a time to heal.

While they didn't want to rely too much on the locals, they did require a percentage of their resources. After the ealdorman stated they could give a certain number of bushels of grain, Peter told him to give them a lesser amount.

However, when a fellow swordsmith, Ernst van Hoorn, started their own business, van Hoorn realized they lacked real skill to compete with the others in the area and so began to find other ways to monopolize on the swordsmithing trade, pushing anyone out of business or making false accusations, like accusing Hattori of working with havekars.Hattori tried to fight back and took the matter to town hall, but with van Hoorn backed by a local gang leader, Cleaver, Hattori's appeal was denied.

As its leader, he was known to most as the King of the Wild Hunt. Eredin was a high ranking general in his world until he killed the king and became his successor.Despite being a notable strong soldier who was also skilled in magic, not much was known about his younger years.When King Auberon Muircetach, ruler of the Aen Elle elves, created the Red Riders, he appointed Eredin as their leader and general. Eredin, who at the time could access the Gate of the Worlds, allowing him to travel to different worlds at will, used the Gate and led the Red Riders in raiding many different worlds. Their main objective was to find and secure a sufficient number of humanoid - preferably human - slaves, that could serve the elves. Over time, this made Eredin and his men infamous and feared and they began to use magic to make themselves look even more menacing, like skeleton shaped armor and altering their voices.As time went on, they eventually rediscovered their original homeworld: the Aen Seidhe world where, prior to the Conjunction of the Spheres, all elves were from. However, it was now controlled by humans and since the Aen Elle had a deep hatred towards the race, the Aen Seidhe world became their primary target with Eredin often leading raids on the world and stealing a great number of young individuals. People from that world quickly started to fear the riders and they gave them a new name - the Wild Hunt. Because Eredin always led his men personally, he was present almost all the time and, as the lead rider, he caused the most fear in the common folk and soon they started to call him the King of the Wild Hunt.An unknown time later, the unicorns freed themselves from the grasp of the Aen Elle and took the Gate from them, meaning Eredin could no longer use it. This also caused all the elves to be stuck in their world with no access to more slaves and so they began to study the magic of traveling to different realms. However, they were only partially successful and created navigators - specialized mages trained to open portals to different worlds, but they could only transport a small group of riders. Due to this, the riders used spectral forms in place of physical and traveled in the skies as a cavalcade of specters.Around 1267 the Wild Hunt sensed a certain individual with very powerful Elder blood who turned out to be a little girl named Cirilla. As Elder blood was crucial for regaining access to the Gate of the Worlds, Eredin set his sights on capturing her as he wanted to resume his invasions of other realms. The Wild Hunt first tried to catch her near the city of Gors Velen but this failed and his continued search for her proved fruitless. However, thanks to his fellow elf Avallac'h, who lured Ciri to the Aen Elle world and took her to the palace in Tir n� Lia, Eredin was finally able to confront her and the two elves gave her an ultimatum: either she lay with the king and give him a child that would reintroduce the Elder blood to the elves - thus possibly giving them access to the Gate again - or she would never leave the palace. Ciri eventually agreed and tried to fulfill her end of the bargain but Auberon was very old and hated humans, considering them little more than animals. Because of this, he was unable to perform and produce a child with Ciri. Eredin, sensing an opportunity, gave an aphrodisiac to his king that was actually a poison, killing Auberon. This, in turn, made Eredin the successor to the crown.With the king dead, chaos spread in the palace and Ciri, with the help of the unicorns, managed to escape not only the palace but the Aen Elle world altogether. Eredin pursued her with the Wild Hunt but she managed to evade them and so he returned to the palace empty handed.Once he returned, he proclaimed himself the new king, having made sure nobody knew about his role in Auberon's death. Only Avallac'h suspected Eredin, but he had no proof so he left the palace and went searching for Ciri on his own.Meanwhile, Eredin consolidated his power and made a few changes. Because he had no interest in the governing aspects that come with being a king, he appointed Ge'els to serve as his viceroy and take care of the state while he was leading the Wild Hunt. He also chose two elves as his most trusted generals - Caranthir as a chief navigator and Imlerith as a commander of the riders.He also haunted Ciri as a wraith while she rested in a French tavern, telling her that he would wait for her on The Spiral - a place he said she would eventually enter after her long journey through space and time.The Aen Elle world soon faced a new and dangerous threat known as the White Frost - a deadly phenomenon that caused an eternal winter, killing off everything that once inhabited the world, and was supposed to be the eventual end of every known world. Eredin decided the only way to escape the apocalypse would be to move the Aen Elle to the world of the Aen Seidhe and conquer it. However, his navigators lacked the power to move thousands of Aen Elle elves. Knowing Ciri's power would be able to create a large enough portal for his people, even if it were to kill her in the process, thus Eredin began to hunt for Ciri once more.This time however he tried something new. He knew that Ciri had loved ones so his new approach was to capture them and hopefully lure her into a trap while she attempted to save them. Thus he and his raiders went to Malus Island where Ciri's adoptive parents - Geralt of Rivia and Yennefer of Vengerberg - lived. Though Geralt managed to cut down many of the attackers, Eredin was able to kidnap the sorceress and took off with her. Geralt pursued him and was joined at one point by several witchers from the School of the Viper and, together, they caught up with the Hunt near the Hanged Man's tree in Nilfgaard and began to fight the Hunt. While the witchers proved to be capable fighters, they were too outnumbered, so Geralt offered to take Yennefer's place and Eredin agreed, releasing Yennefer.For some time, the witcher rode with the Wild Hunt and Eredin was satisfied as Geralt was an excellent lure for Ciri. As expected, she soon found out and in 1270 she managed to save Geralt from Eredin's grasp while not getting caught herself. Despite this, Eredin continued to haunt Geralt using his spectral form and eventually the two had a confrontation (with Eredin still in his spectral form) before he re-focused his efforts on Ciri, who by that point was being helped by Avallac'h.Eredin and the Hunt pursued the duo for over a year until one day the pair teleported to Ard Skellig. Sensing the power that came from such a teleportation, Eredin ambushed them in the forest and managed to inflict an extremely powerful Aen Undod curse upon Avallac'h that would slowly transformer the sage into a diminutive creature that humans would later call Uma. However, Avallac'h was not one to go down easily and cast a powerful spell that wrought havoc in the Hunt's ranks, destroying much of the forest, allowing the duo to escape, albeit ending up in different regions. Ciri ended up in Velen where she lost conscious and the Crones found her. However, the Crones served Eredin and when he was informed they had Ciri, he sent Imlerith to retrieve her. However, Ciri had managed to wake up and learn what the Crones had planned and escaped once more.Sometime later she returned to Skellige, this time to the village of Hindarsfjall, but not even a day later the Hunt attacked again. One of the locals, Skjall, helped her escape to where Avallac'h was waiting for her with Eredin and the Hunt hot on their heels, but the two made out into the water, leaving their pursuers on shore.With Ciri's location now unknown, Eredin waited for another chance Ciri might use her ability, giving her location away once more. Eventually Geralt, who learned Avallac'h had hidden her on the Isle of Mists, recovered her and the Hunt appeared, forcing Ciri to use her teleportation to transport her and Geralt to Kaer Morhen.Now knowing the location of Ciri, the Wild Hunt attacked the witcher keep in full force and Imlerith and Caranthir personally took part in the fight, but Eredin watched rather than join in himself. However, the witchers were able to put up a tougher fight than expected and Eredin called his generals away before blasting through into the courtyard with a powerful frost spell, freezing everyone caught in the blast, including Geralt.Ciri and Vesemir, who'd been shielded by a wall, were the only ones not affected and while the old witcher tried his best to get Ciri to safety, he was caught by Imlerith who began to beat him up when Eredin stopped him, realizing they could use his life as blackmail to get Ciri to go with them. Despite Vesemir's protests to not do it, Ciri started to walk unarmed towards Eredin so Vesemir stabbed Imlerith who angrily snapped the witcher's neck. Seeing the death of her old mentor, Ciri's grief and rage, mixed with her Elder blood, caused a burst of raw magical power, threatening to kill not just the Wild Hunt and Eredin, but all the witchers in the area as well. Eredin, driven by the need to capture Ciri regardless, tried in vain to get to her, but Caranthir opened a portal and teleported himself and the king away, ending the battle.In the days following Eredin's humiliating retreat, the Aen Elle king received a few devastating blows to his power base, starting with Imlerith being slain by Geralt at the Sabbath before the White Wolf and Avallac'h traveled to Tir n� Lia to show Ge'els via onieromancy of Eredin's regicide, which prompted the viceroy to refuse reinforcements should Eredin call for aid.Eventually, Eredin responded to a call from Ciri using the Sunstone, prompting him to redirect the Naglfar to the coast of Undvik. He soon found that it was in fact a trap, as the Wild Hunt was beset by both Nilfgaardians and Skelligers. On the deck of his ship, Eredin faced Crach an Craite and the elf proceeded to toy with the jarl, dealing him grievous wounds before asking if he had any final words. Crach refused and went in for one last attack, which Eredin cut down with ease, killing the jarl.He was then confronted by Geralt and Eredin proclaimed he had something to tell the witcher but would only reveal it as the witcher was dying. As they battled, Eredin opened various portals into other realms where the two continued to fight before returning back to the Naglfar and where Geralt proceeded to stab Eredin in his left eye before dealing a fatal blow. Dying, Eredin confessed that Avallac'h had manipulated both of them into this confrontation so he could use Ciri for his own purposes before succumbing to his wounds.Eredin Br�acc Glas is one of playable characters in MOBA \"\"The Witcher Battle Arena\"\" added with Season 3 Update and has a lot of interesting weapons</td></tr><tr><td>468</td><td>Ernst van Hoorn</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>Swordsmith</td><td> Cleaver</td><td>What van Hoorn lacked in his swordsmithing abilities he made up for in his undermining skills. With a plan in mind, he approached Cleaver and managed to make a deal with his gang to back him up and help monopolize the swordsmithing trade in the city. With the gang at his back, Van Hoorn then began to either buy out his competition by buying their debts and running them out of business, making accusations or, if they were nonhuman, accused them of being havekars, such as the master swordsmith �ibhear Hattori.To further protect his monopoly, van Hoorn also worked with Cleaver to control all the supplies needed to make swords, hoarding most of them in warehouses and where they sat unused.If Geralt helps Hattori get back into business: Van Hoorn soon learned that Hattori planned to get around his monopoly and set out to stop him, eventually confronting Geralt and the elf's bodyguard, Sukrus, as they were stealing supplies from one of his warehouses.</td></tr><tr><td>469</td><td>Eryka</td><td>Human</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Eryka was a blonde Skellige woman who sometimed watched fistfights organized in front of The New Port.

Following King Bran's death, this expedition against Myrhyff was Hjalmar's attempt at a heroic deed, one which would allow him to make a claim for Skellige's throne. Thus the warriors who joined the expedition, Folan included, travelled to Undvik.On Undvik, the group encamped and Folan was assigned to night watch. While on duty, he spotted Egnar of Faroe steal Hjalmar's Hornwall horn, which the jarl's son used to drive away sirens. Folan then chased Egnar across the island, all the while shooting the thief with arrows. The pursuit continued through a nekker lair near an abandoned village, and ended when, eventually, Folan caught up with Egnar, who screamed and attracted the attention of some ice trolls from a nearby cave.While Egnar died from injuries inflicted upon him by the arrows, the trolls kidnapped Folan and placed him into a cauldron intending to use him for a stew. Some time later, when Folan was about to be cooked, Geralt of Rivia arrived on Undvik searching for Hjalmar and the missing crew.If Geralt did not find Folan: It is unknown exactly what became of Folan, though it is likely that he was killed and consumed by the ice trolls that kidnapped him.If Geralt found and saved Folan: Geralt followed the trail of footsteps and blood left by Folan's pursuit of Egnar, and came upon the cave where Folan was being held. Either by killing the trolls, or solving their riddle, Geralt freed Folan whose skin had turned very red from the heat of the cauldron. Folan then accompanied the witcher on the search for Hjalmar, which eventually led them to the Dorve Ruins.

She was also the second cousin of Anna Henrietta of Toussaint. She was a woman with natural grace, green eyes and close-cropped black hair. During the First Northern War Fringilla fought for Nilfgaard at the Battle of Sodden Hill where she blinded Yennefer who was fighting on the opposing side.When Geralt and his team reached Toussaint, Fringilla embarked on a romantic relationship with Geralt and did everything in her power to keep him from leaving the castle. While the witcher did develop some feelings for her, he never quite was able to put Yennefer out of his mind, even going so far as to use Yennefer's name instead of Fringilla's in the throes of passion.In Nilfgaard, Fringilla was approached by Assire var Anahid who offered her the chance to become a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. While initially surprised by Assire's appearance, since Assire never really put effort into her appearance before, Assire pointed out that Fringilla had always been one to put effort into her own looks, noting that among Nilfgaardian mages Fringilla didn't care about their stereotypes (as Nilfgaard believed mages that focused on their looks were superficial). The two southern sorceresses then discussed events at Nilfgaard's court before preparing to meet the Lodge.The two teleported to Montecalvo, where they met the other members of the Lodge. However, when a reluctant Yennefer appeared with Francesca and Ida, Yennefer immediately recognized Fringilla, as the two fought on opposite sides in the Battle of Sodden Hill. Using this to her advantage, Fringilla was able to talk to Yennefer alone during a break in the meeting and, knowing Yennefer was trying to escape to get to Ciri, gave her hints on how to get around Montecalvo's impenetrable barrier.Imprisoned by Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself, due to her treasonous connections with the Lodge, Fringilla was sought after by her former associates, along with Geralt, in their bid to defy and defeat the Wild Hunt near Undvik on Skellige Islands.</td></tr><tr><td>484</td><td>Fritjof</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>Vaedermakar</td><td> Skellige Druid Inner Circle</td><td>Fritjof was a vaedermakar (a druid with the ability to manipulate weather) of the Skellige Circle, and an old friend of Gremist.</td></tr><tr><td>485</td><td>Fugas</td><td>Sylvan</td><td>Male</td><td>Guard of Bald Mountain</td><td> Crones</td><td>Fandom may earn an affiliate commission on sales made from links on this page.</td></tr><tr><td>486</td><td>Gaetan</td><td>Human (Witcher)</td><td>Male</td><td>Witcher</td><td> Cat School</td><td>Gaetan was a witcher from the Cat School who, around 1272, ended up in Velen.He took a contract on a leshen that terrorized Honorton village but after he killed it the ealdorman refused to pay the agreed upon sum, instead offering Gaetan only 12 , a very paltry sum for taking care of the leshen. The witcher voiced his objection at this and so the ealdorman and a couple other villagers claimed they had hid the rest of the gold in the barn and led him out there to get the rest of the payment. However, it proved to be a trap where the group tried to murder the witcher and only at the last minute when Gaetan realized something was awry did he narrowly avoid being fatally pierced by a pitchfork. Still injured and now incensed at this, Gaetan went on a killing spree, blindly killing every villager for trying to cheat and kill him, whether they were guilty or not. He only stopped short of killing a little girl, Millie, as she reminded him of his own sister, thus sparing her, making her the only survivor of the village massacre.If Geralt investigates: Geralt eventually discovered Gaetan not far from the village and still recovering from his injuries. After telling Geralt about what transpired, he insinuated this wasn't the first time he'd lost his temper.</td></tr><tr><td>487</td><td>Gascoigne</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Gascoigne was a bard traveling with a fellow bard, Victor, along the road to Yantra in 1272 when the two had stopped to set up a small campfire and drink.If Geralt partakes in drinking with them: after Geralt fell asleep, the two bards took all the witcher's possessions and ran off to Yantra, intending to sell the items.</td></tr><tr><td>488</td><td>Gaspard</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>Real estate</td><td> Rabenick and Company</td><td>Gaspard along with two others, Ivo and Ferenc, had set out in different directions in search for help or a way off the island when he ended up at the top of the lighthouse before falling asleep.

O'Dimm asked to buy the witcher a drink, and that he knew about Geralt and Yennefer based off Dandelion's ballads.Pushing for an answer, Geralt continued asking whether he had seen Yennefer, so O'Dimm told him local rumours he had heard and advised him to go to the nearby Nilfgaardian Garrison nearby to continue his search. He remarked that he didn't need a reward as one day he may need Geralt's help and then suddenly disappeared.[1]When a captive Geralt was on a ship en route to Ofier to await execution for unknowingly killing the Ofieri Prince, Gaunter O'Dimm mysteriously appeared. He offered to help free Geralt in exchange for a small favor. When Geralt agreed, O'Dimm burned a mark on his face as a sign of their bargain. He then caused a storm to destroy the ship and gave Geralt an opening to escape.The two later reunited at O'Dimm's rendezvous point at the crossroads of Yantra at midnight. There, O'Dimm contracted Geralt into helping him finish up a different contract: to grant three wishes to the immortal Olgierd, telling him once the wishes have been granted he will free Geralt of his pact.O'Dimm reappeared when Geralt went to confront Olgierd. As it turned out, their pact required a proxy to fulfill Olgierd's wishes. After Olgierd gave Geralt his first two wishes (to show his brother Vlodimir the time of his life and to bring him Maximilian Borsodi's house) O'Dimm appeared before Geralt, offering his help as the contract did not forbid it. He informed Geralt that Vlodimir was already deceased and thus provided a vial of von Everec blood to perform a Blood Summoning. However, he refused to make things easy on Geralt, telling him to rely on his wit and intelligence when it came to Maximilian Borsodi's house.Gaunter O'Dimm's true identity remained a mystery throughout most of the story, though he appeared to be a powerful being as he could take souls, grant wishes, see things for their true nature, cause ghosts pain, and could manipulate time itself, making Geralt increasingly suspicious of the true nature of O'Dimm. Despite asking who he is, O'Dimm refused to reveal his true name to Geralt, warning him that those who learned it suffered a terrible fate. While seemingly almost untouchable, Geralt did learn that O'Dimm had one weakness: he loved to make deals with anyone who asked as long as the payment was their soul. Playing into this, he will also take up challenges where one's soul is at stake, as he almost always won (with the exception of one person who had beaten him at his own game).However, his deals were often filled with conditions and wordplay loopholes through which O'Dimm could claim payment, apparently often Faustian in nature. The clearest example of this trickery was shown with one Professor Premethine Shakeslock: O'Dimm granted him physical protection but forced him to remain within a spell diagram, caused mental damage with dreams and visions, and then set a trap to kill Shakeslock should he ever leave the circle.Through the tasks Olgierd made him do, Geralt learned that Olgierd had previously made a pact with O'Dimm for the restoration of his wealth and power so that he could once again be of nobility and marry his noble-born love. However, O'Dimm delighted in difficult decisions and made Olgierd choose between sacrificing Iris or Vlodimir before granting his wish; Olgierd chose his brother, causing him to die the next day. However it was shown that as a \"\"side effect\"\" of his fulfilled desires</td></tr><tr><td>490</td><td>Ge'els</td><td>Elf (Aen Elle)</td><td>Male</td><td>Viceroy of Tir n� Lia</td><td> Wild Hunt</td><td>Ge'els was an elf of the Aen Elle, a member of the Dearg Ruadhri and one of Eredin's most trusted lieutenants together with Imlerith and Caranthir.

Instead, he was assigned to rule the Aen Elle world in Eredin's stead while the king was leading the Red Riders. While he had great skill in plotting and politics, he was also righteous.In 1272, in order to weaken Eredin, Avallac'h and Geralt travelled to Tir n� Lia in order to find Ge'els and convince him to break his support from Eredin, by revealing that Eredin murdered King Auberon, whom Ge'els admired.When they finally arrived, they found Ge'els painting a portrait in his garden of an elven woman. Rather than calling the guards, he heard what Geralt and Avallac'h had to say, and agreed to return with them back to Novigrad. When they arrived, they had Corinne Tilly use her power of oneiromancy to reveal Eredin's treachery. Once the dream ended, Ge'els advised them to fight Eredin in their own world, and to lure him there using the Sunstone on Skellige.

The jarl did not wish to abandon his homeland, however, and stayed to fight the giant along with three of his crewmen, Wilmar, Wilfred, and Wilhelm. While all of his crewmen perished, Harald was spared by Myrhyff and tasked to build a longship which the giant wanted to sail out on to defeat the gods during Ragh nar Roog. The hull of the ship became Harald's home where he also placed the skulls of his dead crewmen and kept referring to them by name, believing them to be still alive.Harald did not often venture out of the ship, for fear of being killed by the ice giant, and any time he did, he would be brought back to the ship by sirens. Myrhyff often brought human flesh for the sirens and Harald, which he likely harvested from the bodies of those he killed.A year after the giant's arrival, Geralt of Rivia visited Undvik to look for Hjalmar an Craite and his missing crew, who had ventured out on an expedition to the island to slay Myrhyff.

The people who had been killed in the revolt had allegedly been found in the gutter, with their throats slit from ear to ear with surgical precision. Following these events, Rejk left the University and moved to Novigrad where he found work in the city morgue as a coroner. It was in Novigrad, around the early 1270s that Rejk used his vampiric abilities to murder people which he deemed immoral, those which, in his mind, had strayed from the path of the Eternal Fire.

He wielded great power, and was one of the most formidable opponents Geralt encountered. Geralt and Imlerith were also acquaintances during Geralt's service with the hunt. The Hunt's second general alongside Imlerith was Caranthir Ar-Feiniel.When Ciri returned to the Continent, Imlerith ordered the Crones to keep an eye out for her. The witches took his order literally as they hung human ears throughout Crookback Bog. When Ciri later teleported to Crookback Bog, she fell into the hands of the Crones but escaped, running back into the woods. Imlerith pursued her on horseback but she managed to evade him.Imlerith later participated in the battle of Kaer Morhen, his presence forcing Geralt's hunting party to retreat. Imlerith gave pursuit, but the witchers made it inside the keep and closed the main gate, to which Imlerith furiously pounded his mace against it.The Hunt eventually broke into the heart of Kaer Morhen, freezing everyone but Ciri and Vesemir. Imlerith engaged the old witcher, enabling Eredin to get a hold of Ciri. Vesemir broke away and stopped Eredin from escaping with Ciri. Imlerith charged at Vesemir, wrapping his hands around his throat just as the witcher pushed Ciri away with Aard. He began strangling Vesemir but ceased at his king's command, to use Vesemir to force Ciri to surrender. Just as Ciri dropped her sword and the Hunt's victory seemed all but assured, Vesemir stabbed Imlerith with a knife. The attack purposefully provoked Imlerith, who proceeded to effortlessly snap Vesemir's neck, killing him. In a grief stricken rage, Ciri unleashed a magical scream that left the Hunt clutching their heads in agony. Imlerith quickly fled through a portal conjured by Caranthir.A few weeks later, Imlerith attended the Sabbath in southern Velen, where he is shown leisurely seated back in a throne accompanied by succubi at his feet. Confronted by Geralt of Rivia, the succubi slowly fled the scene and the mighty Imlerith's unperturbed gaze calmly fixated on the witcher. The elf then presumed to inquire if Ciri was with him. If Geralt chose to lie, Imlerith did not believe him. If Geralt confirmed that Ciri was with him, Imlerith demanded her location but was refused. Either way, Imlerlith rose and donned his helmet, menacing mace, and towering shield before engaging Geralt in combat.Geralt's speed made for a formidable method of combatting the spectre's slower, massive mace swings. Halfway through the battle, Imerlith ditched his giant shield to begin a constant multitude of whirling strikes. Toward the conclusion of the grueling duel, Geralt ran the giant through. Unflinching, with brute strength, Imlerith's mighty hands pounded downward forcing the sword from his body and Geralt's hands. The general then gripped the momentarily staggered Geralt's neck with both hands while he swiftly lifted him in the air. He then asked the witcher who taught him to fight as he did. Geralt responded that it was the witcher he murdered (referencing Vesemir), before force-feeding a devastating Igni blast through the grill of Imlerith's helmet.Consequently, the elf sustained severe burns to his head and neck. As he took off his glowing red-hot helmet and faced death with a devilish smile, Geralt grabbed hold of the monstrous mace and caved in his head from above, finally ending the cruel and sadistic Aen Elle general for good.Imlerith initially starts combat with his massive mace and shield, and he definitely meets the description of \"\"walking tank\"\".

Though skeptical, Ingrid nonetheless agrees to check on Patricia. When they reach Patricia's bedroom, Ingrid assumes from the closed door that all is well, though Geralt insists that she go inside.Upon opening the door, Ingrid sees her mother dead, stripped naked and cuffed to the bed as the killer flees. Geralt gives chase but the confusion among the guards led them to mistake him for the culprit, resulting the witcher being detained and allowing the real killer to escape. Ingrid rebukes her guard for his ineptitude, who releases Geralt. Geralt then requests to inspect her mother's body, as the killer usually left a note on the body. Ingrid granted him permission and left him alone, not wanting to see her mother in her current state.In the quest A Matter of Life and Death, Ingrid requests Triss' aid in smuggling her son Albert from her estate past the witch hunters in exchange for her support in helping the mages escape Novigrad.</td></tr><tr><td>553</td><td>Innkeep</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Fandom may earn an affiliate commission on sales made from links on this page.</td></tr><tr><td>554</td><td>Innkeep</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Fandom may earn an affiliate commission on sales made from links on this page.</td></tr><tr><td>555</td><td>Innkeep</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>The innkeep in Harviken plays gwent.

Eventually, Steingard succeeded, even though the storm was stronger than expected and wrecked the Flying Stag, killing the crew.Kiyan was then misused by Steingard and had been the subject of cruel experiments to test the physical and mental endurance of witchers. He was also interrogated and forced to reveal secrets about witcher training, and the Cat School of Witchers in particular. Steingard was pleased that Kiyan confirmed his theories: that the Cat School has elven origins. Kiyan's body survived the excruciating treatment, however, his mind was overwhelmed by the procedure after four days.Ireneus var Steingrad continued his study regardless of this fact, turning the former witcher Kiyan into a crazed and tormented shell of his former self, driven only by immense pain. This version of Kiyan, Mad Kiyan, can be found in the abandoned laboratory below Novigrad's Temple Isle, where Geralt of Rivia encounters it. Here, the former witcher can be defeated and killed, relieving Kiyan from his fate.Mad Kiyan is the crazed and possibly possessed version of the witcher Kiyan of the Cat School. The mage Ireneus var Steingard captured and performed experiments on Kiyan in his laboratory below Novigrad, tormenting both his mind and body beyond recognition. Mad Kiyan is thus an insane shell of the witcher only driven by immense pain and the urge to kill intruders.Geralt of Rivia can encounter and relieve him from his suffering in the abandoned laboratory below Novigrad. However, Mad Kiyan can prove a serious threat to Geralt since even though the mind of a human being is no longer inhabiting Mad Kiyan's body, his skills in battle remain. Mad Kiyan can use Signs consisting of a bubble of Quen, a version of Igni and Aard. His blows with a Moonblade are fast and can cause bleeding.Despite all these skills in battle, Mad Kiyan's vocabulary is restricted to muttering \"\"No good. No evil. Only pain.</td></tr><tr><td>588</td><td>Kluhg</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>At one point, he was detained and interrogated by the commander of the Temple Guard, Caleb Menge, but was later released.

His closest associates were Auckes and Serrit, also kingslayers and fellow witchers from the School of the Viper. Letho enlisted the help of Iorveth and the Scoia'tael to aid him in his plan to kill the kings of the Northern Kingdoms; to back his claim, the Viper showed Iorveth a head that belonged to Demavend III, the king of Aedirn, whom Letho had previously slain.In the forests of Angren on July 25, 1270, Letho was near death after being struck by a slyzard's tail but Geralt, a witcher from the School of the Wolf, found and saved him while chasing after the Wild Hunt to rescue Yennefer. As thanks for saving his life, Letho told Geralt where to find the Wild Hunt and, alongside his own companions, travelled with him to find the spectral riders. Eventually, the group caught up with the Wild Hunt on the Winter Solstice, by the Hanged Man's Tree in Nilfgaard. Despite their skill, the witchers couldn't defeat all the warriors and a stalemate ensued before Geralt offered himself in exchange for Yennefer.Feeling it'd be disrespectful to Geralt to just leave the sorceress somewhere, Letho and the witchers took care of her. However, she was in pain, suffering from amnesia and caused an endless source of trouble for the group, which, in the Nilfgaardian Empire, meant she was liable to get caught and killed. While the group traveled constantly to try and avoid attention, they were eventually detained and thrown in jail. However, Emperor Emhyr var Emreis himself later approached Letho and offered him a deal he couldn't refuse: sow chaos in the North by killing some of its rulers, lay the blame on the Lodge of Sorceresses, and the School of the Viper would be restored.King Esterad Thyssen of Kovir and Poviss was initially Letho's first target, but this never came to be as the kingslayers came into contact with S�le de Tansarville, who contracted Letho with assassinating King Demavend and helped to organise it. Thus, in 1271, Letho snuck onboard Demavend's ship out on the Pontar and, using a Northern Wind-based capsule, froze most of the ship and nearly everyone on board except a handful that were protected by Abelard's counter spell. However, this wasn't enough and all the guards fell to Letho's blade before he rounded on the king and killed him, then cut off his head for proof. Per de Tansarville's suggestion, Letho subsequently sought out Iorveth with the head in tow; yet, instead of merely using the Scoia'tael in order to lie low after the killing as S�le had envisaged, Letho also secured an alliance between the kingslayers and the Scoia'tael, whereby the latter would help Letho and his comrades to kill the kings of the North in whatever way they could.Because of the kingslayers' first attempt on King Foltest's life having failed due to Geralt being there at the time of the attack and the would-be assassin's death, Letho planned a second attempt on the Temerian monarch's life with Iorveth, while being out of S�le's or anyone else's reach. Aware of the imminent siege at La Valette Castle, Letho decided to pose as a monk guarding over the king's children - a disguise which he enacted by framing himself as a helpless monk being tortured and then killing the person who treated him to keep the secret. Foltest, after successfully taking over the castle, appeared with Geralt, now acting as a bodyguard, at which point the king asked for Geralt to give him and the children some space. With his back turned, Geralt heard the attack too late as Letho revealed himself just after he killed Foltest and fled out a window to escape with Scoia'tael assistance, leaving Geralt to be wrongly accused of regicide. Shortly after this assassination, Letho attempted to betray Iorveth by turning one of his lieutenants against him. However, the elf refused, so Letho killed his entire unit to cover his tracks and left Ciaran to be captured by Flotsam's guards.In an attempt to catch Letho, Geralt, who now knew that Letho had attempted to get rid of Iorveth, the elf to the kingslayer as a ruse to expose the latter's treachery. However, Iorveth and his Scoia'tael were attacked by the Blue Stripes, leaving Geralt and Letho to battle each other. Letho prevailed in the battle with Geralt, but once the Wolf was down, he spared him.

However, his scorned lover didn't forget this and planted a nithing outside his hut, cursing his son to the point he'd die soon if it wasn't lifted.If Geralt investigates: Geralt asked Jonna to lift the curse, who agreed but for a steep price: she wanted Lothar to denounce his family and return to her, which would strip his family of honor and condemn them to poverty.

The curse not only bound him to the garden for eternity, it also gave him an immense hunger that no food or prey could ever satisfy as it immediately turns to ash.

Originally, Morvran's father was proposed but later they decided to put young Morvran on the Imperial throne. Before they could take any real steps, however, Leuvaarden betrayed them and they were subsequently sentenced to death.[1]Sometime after the death of Tibor Eggebracht, Morvran was appointed as the commander of an armored Alba Division and also joined Berengar Leuvaarden's Guild of Merchants.

He took up residence in Crow's Perch after its previous owner, Vserad, fled to Fyke Isle with his family due to the threat of approaching armies.Phillip served in several wars fighting for Temeria throughout his life. During the Battle of Anchor, he took a spear in the shoulder and was tended to by Anna. Once he'd recovered, he asked her to marry him and the couple appeared to be happy and soon welcomed a baby girl, Tamara. Shortly after she was born though, Phillip was sent to Cidaris to fight in another war, this time to aid King Ethain on King Foltest's behalf. As he was seldom home, Phillip turned to drinking and soon become so dependent on it, he couldn't stop drinking even when he was home. This led to one of Tamara's first memories of him drunk and caked in mud under the stairs.Several years into the marriage, he came home one day to find Anna and their daughter gone. In their place was a note, with Anna saying she didn't love him and she'd left him for a childhood friend and the man she'd been having an affair with for the past three years, Evan, and had taken Tamara with her. Phillip then headed out to bring the girls back, but when he saw Evan, something snapped and he ended up killing the man. Upset at what Phillip did, Anna began to yell and claw at him before picking up a knife and trying to stab him. Phillip moved out of the way just in time and, not knowing what else to do, beat her. This event marked the change in their relationship to an abusive one.Many years later, during the Third Northern War, Phillip's unit was all but destroyed near the start of the invasion. Having no hope in regrouping, they began to wander north and soon other deserters and broken men joined them. By the time Phillip reached Crow's Perch, which had been abandoned by its previous lord, he had a sizable group under his command and decided to settle there, including his wife and daughter. Phillip then decided to back Nilfgaard, realizing it was impractical to resist them, and hoped to be made an official baron once they won.In 1272, he had another drunken fight with Anna, who was pregnant again, before passing out. When he came to, he couldn't remember all that'd happened but found the fetus dead in their bedroom, believed to have been a miscarriage, and Anna and Tamara gone. He proceeded to hastily bury the stillborn in a shallow grave and had all his men out searching for the women, but nobody could find a trace of them. A short time later, a peasant brought Ciri and a little girl, Gretka, to him as Ciri was injured and both were hungry. He took them in, giving Gretka a place to stay (as sending her back to a starving family wouldn't do any good) and let Ciri stay as long as she liked.Phillip and his men went on at least one hunting trip with Ciri, who impressed the group with how she killed a boar, before she extended a friendly challenge to Phillip in the form of a horse race after seeing one of his nice horses. The next morning, the two raced against each other, only to be interrupted by a basilisk. They fought against it but it got the upperhand and carried Phillip up to the top of its tower, intending to kill him. Using her powers, Ciri appeared in front of the basilisk and proceeded to kill it, stunning Phillip. However, as the Wild Hunt could sense when she used her powers, Ciri was forced to flee once more so Phillip helped her out and gave her a letter of safe conduct so she could get to Novigrad safely.Sometime later, Geralt arrived in hopes of finding information on Ciri and, recognizing who he was from what Ciri told him, Phillip talked to the witcher before offering a trade: if Geralt would help him find his missing wife and daughter, he'd tell him where Ciri went. Having not much of a choice, the witcher agreed and set out to find them.Phillip, however, hadn't told Geralt the full story of the night the women disappeared, nor the abusive relationship between him and Anna. When Geralt was visiting the Pellar, Phillip got drunk once more and the barn at Crow's Perch was struck by lightning, engulfing it in flames that nobody dared to put out as Phillip was in his mad, drunken state. When Geralt returned during all this, he had a brief fistfight with Phillip before dunking him in water and demanding he tell the full story, as the Pellar had filled the witcher in on some of the details. Phillip came clean on the abuse and where he buried the stillborn before Geralt informed him the baby had turned into a botchling and needed to be dealt with. Phillip then begged the witcher not to put his child through anymore pain.After the botchling was dealt with, Phillip refused to tell Geralt anymore on Ciri until he found Anna and Tamara.</td></tr><tr><td>711</td><td>Piet</td><td>Human</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Fandom may earn an affiliate commission on sales made from links on this page.</td></tr><tr><td>712</td><td>Polly</td><td>Human</td><td>Female</td><td>Choreographer</td><td> Chameleon</td><td>In 1272, Dandelion contacted Polly to recruit her for his planned cabaret at the premises of the former Rosemary and Thyme.

Given Princess's affinity for wild strawberries and raspberries, this proved a lengthy task that required the use of a bell, which, when rung, caused Princess to follow the ringer. Upon her return, the Pellar milked the goat for a ritual in which he augured for information about Anna and Tamara.While Princess didn't normally approach other people, she did approach those who were suffering.

His reign became, along with witch hunts, one of the defining factors of the post-war period that followed the Peace of Cintra. Radovid was a polarizing figure: a brilliant strategist and a superb general by some, a paranoid madman by others. There were also many who took the middle view of his policies being harsh but justified.He inherited his titles and estates as the only son of King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore. His two older sisters were Dalimira and Milena. Even though his father died in 1267, Prince Radovid didn't succeed him immediately because he was only twelve at the time and for several years the kingdom was governed by a Regency Council under influential Duke Nitert and Count Sigismund Dijkstra, the then-spymaster of Redanian Secret Service.Radovid bore a deep aversion towards mages that stemmed from his father being secretly assassinated by an unknown elf at the behest of the sorceress advisor Philippa Eilhart,[N 3] who then pulled strings from behind his back, ruled in his name and dominated and demeaned him throughout his youth.Radovid was born in 1255 in Tretogor to the royal pair, King Vizimir II and Queen Hedwig of Malleore, as their third child. He grew up with two older sisters: Dalimira, informally known as Dalka, and Milena, who was known as Milka in a similar fashion. Dalka eventually dedicated her life to the priesthood after her failed engagement with King Foltest of Temeria, who instead chose to marry his own sister Adda, while Milka attended Aretuza to become a sorceress Millegarda.[2]When Prince Radovid was 9 years old he was formally engaged to Cirilla, Princess of Cintra, when she was 12. The engagement was formalized between his father and Queen Calanthe, Ciri's grandmother, but the king broke the engagement off after half a year without giving any explanation and Ciri and Radovid never even had a chance to talk to each other.[3]On the day of the outbreak of the Second Northern War with the Nilfgaardian Empire, his father had unexpectedly fallen victim to an elven assassin.[4] A fact unknown to practically anyone was that it was Philippa Eilhart, at the time fighting on Thanedd Island, who hired the elf in order to gain more direct rule. Redania fell into chaos, as usually happens in such circumstances, and Queen Hedwig was not in a state to control things.[N 3] The aristocracy started to organize itself into factions, attempting to tear some land out for each and every one of them. Several practically licked the boots of Nilfgaardian emissaries led by Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen and were ready to rule with Nilfgaardian blessing, only to be caught off guard and stopped by the famous Redanian Secret Service. There remained but a handful of those who were spared, those with important enough social status and armed might to maintain peace, like Duke Nitert.[4]Nitert was put in charge of the Regency Council appointed to save the realm from a total civil war and they managed to do so, by hanging everyone they deemed traitor in specially modified fortifications with internment camps - most infamous of which would be Drakenborg. Its members, however, overlooked their underage crown prince and none of the Northern Kingdoms' elites, not even Philippa who took it upon herself to raise him, expected him to grow into a firm monarch who would repay all humiliations he and his mother had suffered during the interregnum.A young but decisive, unrelenting King Radovid V's deed quickly earned him the epithet of \"\"the Stern\"\".[5]He began his reign by taking care of various nobles who ruled on their lands rather independently from Tretogor.

He then took to watching over Ciri as she slept for almost a day while the elf went searching for a boat.Once Ciri woke up, he informed her about the elf and how much time had passed before Astrid interrupted their conversation and, with Ciri desperate to get to the location the elf gave her, was sent off to ready a couple horses while Astrid took Ciri to the sauna to help her heal.After Ciri finished up at the sauna and the two got ready to ride out, the Wild Hunt attacked the village and the two helped fight before making a run for the horses. Even though the villagers were in immediate danger, Skjall insisted on getting Ciri to the location to make sure she was safe before returning to the village. However, when he got Ciri to the elf, who was waiting with a boat, he watched as they appeared to argue before the elf used a spell to knock her out and get her on the boat. Seeing this, Skjall raced down to get to them but was knocked down from behind by the Wild Hunt as the boat left shore. Some time later, Skjall woke up long enough to see Uma before passing out once more.When Geralt and Yennefer trace Ciri's steps to Lofoten, they learn that the elders, believing Skjall had fled the battle due to cowardliness, had branded him as Craven. To try and prove his worth and regain his name, he then set out to slay Morkvarg, but failed in this task and died from his wounds. Geralt finds his body and Yennefer reanimates it with the use of Necromancy in an attempt to learn what happened to Ciri on Skellige.After Geralt is reunited with Ciri, she asks to return to Skellige to find Skjall's body and give him a proper burial so she can honor the young man that gave his life so she could live.</td></tr><tr><td>747</td><td>Smith</td><td>Human</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>Smith living in Fyresdal is the local blacksmith.

However, one night while they wandered the city, Shani noticed two spies following them and eventually the inept men accidentally revealed that Thaler was, in fact, the head of Temerian Intelligence, ending their short relationship.Eventually in 1270, Thaler began to pose as a fence in the city to gather intel and was visited by Coleman, who sold him some witcher equipment he'd found. Thaler eventually sold this off to the guards, not realizing it'd soon lead to him crossing paths with the witcher Geralt, who was also looking for the owner of the sword. During this time, King Foltest also left the city for a bit and personally put Thaler in charge while he was away.Shortly after, Geralt visited and, after Thaler revealed what he knew about Berengar, the two parted ways only to meet up again later during an important reception for high class society. However, this time Thaler was now using his real identity, Bernard, and revealed to Geralt who he really was. He eventually asked a favor for a favor and had Geralt retrieve a mysterious letter, not revealing he believed someone was forging documents as Foltest. With the newest letter in hand though he was finally able to confirm it, as the letter was supposedly from Foltest stripping Thaler of his position as chief but was missing the king's signature.As the party winded down, Thaler went outside but soon got into an argument with Roderick de Wett, and while the count remarked Thaler was just mad about being fired, Thaler noted de Wett knew more than he was letting on.If Geralt defends Thaler: Thanks to the witcher stepping in, Thaler was saved from being killed by de Wett and his men.

Not knowing what else to do, he proceeded to drink away his sorrows until his \"\"liver screamed bloody murder\"\" then decided he had to do something about the situation.

The full truth of why though is never revealed.Many locals appear to believe the book She Who Knows, where the spirit is described as someone who arrived from far away and created three daughters and watched over the land. Locals would bring sacrifices like grain and men to her every Spring, but she started to slip more and more into madness to the point the land and its people were being destroyed.

It was through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary gender traits.She was a skilled healer and carried with her many magical potions, but she never uses them on herself because ironically, she was allergic to potions. She was also quite a powerful mage, certainly when it counted most. She wore an amulet - sapphire overlaid with silver.Not much is known about Triss' upbringing.

Enraged at this, Udalryk questioned his father's decision, breaking one of Skellige's sacred laws in doing so, and was subsequently punished by being chained to a pile in the sea for three days. Afterwards, to try and make amends, he and Aki went out on a sailing trip near Ulula's Needle when a storm broke out and Aki fell overboard. Udalryk, who had his hands full with the sails, didn't hear his brother's cry for help until it was too late and Aki drowned.Having failed to save his brother, Udalryk was overcome with immense guilt and sometime afterwards began to hear voices in his sleep that claimed they were messengers from the gods. These voices plagued Udalryk with strange visions and commanded he harm himself as a sacrifice to the gods, like cutting himself deep enough to leave scars, though he viewed this as a gift to hear from the gods so directly.Eventually he became the jarl of Clan Brokvar and by 1272 had his own son, who he named Aki in honor of his deceased brother.</td></tr><tr><td>792</td><td>Ulf</td><td>Human</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>If Geralt comes across them: Geralt gave Petter some Celandine, saying it wouldn't fix his leg just make it hurt less.

She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Supreme Council of Sorcerers within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.At some point, due to her magical potential, she was received in the Aretuza school for sorceresses, where rectoress Tissaia de Vries became her teacher and mother figure. During her training, Yennefer tried to kill herself by cutting both of her wrists, severing her tendons, though she survived. Tissaia claimed that the purposefulness of her attempt was the only thing that prevented her from feeling contempt for her weakness, and continued her training. In accordance with the sorceresses' tradition, any physical flaw, including her hunchback, was magically removed. Yennefer eventually graduated as a sorceress.[4]At some point, Yennefer set herself up in the town of Rinde and, ignoring King Heribert's rules that no magic users could stay in Redania, openly practiced her magic and provided her magical services to clients by staying with Novigrad's ambassador, Beau Berrant, thus granting her asylum from the law while in the ambassador's home. One morning, a witcher intruded on her sleep, revealing himself as Geralt of Rivia and that he needed her assistance in healing his friend, Dandelion, who had been afflicted by a djinn. After an initially rough greeting where Geralt responded sarcastically to her questions, Yennefer agreed to heal the bard, but she secretly made preparations in hopes of capturing the djinn, after Dandelion makes his final wish. When Geralt tried to stop her from using Dandelion, her spell took hold of the witcher, charming him to do her will against those on the town council who were against her. After Geralt is arrested, she has Dandelion, now awakened teleported out into town with instructions to make his wish to free Geralt. Yennefer tried to capture the djinn, but it fought her, destroying a good part of Rinde in the struggle, not knowing that the djinn's master was not Dandelion, but in fact, Geralt, who still held one wish. Geralt arrived to see Yennefer struggle with her spell, and he tried to stop her, leading them to fight one another. She got the better of him, and he revealed to her that he was the one with the last wish that could free the djinn. Geralt knew that the moment he made a wish, Yennefer would be too weak to contain the djinn and it would kill her. So Geralt saved their lives, by wishing their fates were tied together. Yennefer was grateful to the witcher, willing to bind himself to her, and the two began a relationship. TBAYennefer traveled to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander and spoke to Nenneke about a cure for her infertility. While she was at the temple, she spent time looking around for Geralt, and after discovering he wasn't there confronted Nenneke and ended up quarrelling with her, before leaving the temple.During the Battle of Sodden Hill she was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was later magically restored but she still bore the emotional scars.In May 1272, Yennefer sent Geralt a letter, arranging to meet in the village of Willoughby. However the village had been burned down, due to the Third Northern War reaching the region, so she headed through to the Nilfgaardian Garrison, passing through White Orchard in quite a rush. From the garrison, she headed to Vizima, meeting with Emperor Emhyr var Emreis, concerning the location of Ciri. After a while, she heard Geralt was in White Orchard looking for her, so the sorceress rode with a Nilfgaardian escort to the White Orchard inn where she found Geralt and Vesemir. The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though she was nearly a century old. Yennefer had locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular in shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender neck hung a black marigold with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.Yen had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes she wasn't tall, was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs.She always dressed in black and white, at times wore stockings, wore frilled panties but never wore trivialities with underwire, she didn't need to. Her voice was resonant and mildly derisive. Her overall feminine shape was one of a twenty-year-old girl and she moved with a natural, unforced grace. She was a quarter-elf (meaning she had a quarter elven blood, in her case on her mother's side).It is implied that her attractive looks were a product of magic and had been acquired during her training, as with most other sorceresses. Geralt notes how her shoulders are slightly lopsided and by the end of the story realizes that Yennefer used to be a hunchback.

Fergus, being a dwarf, was far more likely to be perceived as a master armorer and thus the two struck an agreement for her to be his assistant, but she was the one crafting all the complex pieces.When the local Nilfgaardian commander came by and ordered a suit of armor that could withstand a shot from a crossbow, Fergus stated it couldn't be done and Yoana, having enough, stated it could actually, with the right tools.If Geralt helps Yoana out and wears the armor: With the special tools from Skellige and help from Geralt, Yoana created a piece of armor that, true to her word, effectively repelled crossbow bolts while Fergus' didn't, showing everyone who was the real master armorer.

However, she offered for him to stay, but this time in the appropriate roles: she as the master armorer and Fergus as the apprentice, and the dwarf agreed.If Geralt refuses to wear the test armor: Having nobody to test her armor for her, the commander pronounced her as a fraud.

It is from Zoltan that Geralt got his sword - Sihil.He also had a talking parrot, Field Marshal Windbag, which he sold to the gnome Percival Schuttenbach when he started a jeweler's workshop in Novigrad.After the Battle of Brenna, where him and his mates killed Field-Marshal Menno Coehoorn, Zoltan got engaged to Eudora Breckenriggs.TBADuring the ensuing chat, the dwarf also mentions that his in-laws-to-be, the Breckenriggs (this name is spelled in a few different and interesting ways throughout the game: Breckering, Breckenridge, ...), who value material possessions more than Zoltan does. Lucky thing, since he has far fewer after the Common Cause Mine failed.Zoltan is the one to acquaint Geralt with dice poker, and to give him a couple of pointers about whom to challenge. After the initial meeting, he can be found in the Inn for the remainder of Chapter I.Later in the game, Zoltan can be found wandering around the Temple Quarter (roughly from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) and, if choosing to side with the Scoia'tael or take the neutral path, in the Old Vizima. He also often spends time with Golan Vivaldi. Arrives at Golan Vivaldi's home at 10:30 during chapter 2.If Geralt outdrinks him at the Inn, Zoltan will give him a Diamond.Zoltan once again appears in the second witcher game. His appearance has only slightly changed. Although originally expected to have the same voice actor as the original witcher game, he was ultimately voiced by Alexander Morton. His first appearance in the game is standing on a gallows platform in Flotsam during Chapter I. He is saved from being hanged (His crime? Colluding with the Scoia'tael) alongside another friend of Geralt's - Dandelion (himself accused of debauchery, or maybe setting fire to a tower, or possibly both!).Since they saw each other last, Zoltan's engagement to Eudora Breckenriggs has fallen through, as has his career in the mining industry, so he's settled for life as a \"\"simple merchant\"\"</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"]}}],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The data that I will be using for the classification is the text column and the race column.

However, he didn't let his feelings get in the way when he saw that Geralt was also infatuated with Yennefer and even pulled the others away when he saw the two having sex in his cousin's destroyed inn after fighting off a djinn.In Chapter IV, at the Lakeside, Chireadan, an elf among Toruviel's ragtag group recognizes Geralt. It seems he knows the witcher from somewhere before, but of course Geralt has no memory of him. This previous encounter, which is not described in any further detail, is a reference to the The Last Wish.He is also a sharper, and thus one of the available dice players. He can be found any time, day or night to play. During the day, he is typically sitting at one of the two campfires nearest the Elven Cave. At night, he will be sleeping in the cave, but does not complain at all about being woken up just for a game.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>Elven craftsman</td><td>Elf (Aen Seidhe)</td><td>Male</td><td>Master craftsman</td><td> Toruviel</td><td>The elven craftsman was part of Toruviel's band of starving elves who camped in the cave by the Lakeside in Murky Waters. He was looking for four pieces of centipede armor for his work and was willing to pay. He was also a master craftsman, though the term slightly offended his artistic nature, and was capable of doing many things: mirror reassembly being one such skill.He was well versed in the history of Raven's armor.</td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td>Golan Vivaldi</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>Banker</td><td> Vivaldi Bank (Vizima branch)</td><td>\"Golan Vivaldi is a dwarf, and part of the \"\"Vivaldi family\"\"</td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td>Malcolm Stein</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>Blacksmith Merchant</td><td> Scoia'tael</td><td>His main competition in town is the Order armorer, who has recently acquired some Mahakaman anvils remarkably similar to those confiscated by the City Guard from Malcolm's own smithy. But if things seem bleak in Chapter II, they are even bleaker in Chapter III where his workplace is pretty much reduced to a firepit.In Chapter V, it seems Malcolm has relocated to the makeshift forge in Old Vizima to help the Scoia'tael cause. It is he who makes the Scoia'tael (elven) variant of the Raven's armor for Geralt. Although he is not specifically identified, the conversation he has with Geralt would only make sense if it was Malcolm.</td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td>Munro Bruys</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>Bouncer[1]Soldier (formerly)</td><td> Mahakam Volunteer Army (formerly)Zoltan Chivay's company (formerly)</td><td>Munro Bruys was an adventurer from Mahakam in the company of Zoltan Chivay during the 1260s. After the Battle of Brenna, in which he avenged one of his mates Caleb Stratton, Bruys planned to do business in Novigrad. Eventually, he ended up a bouncer in Vizima.A dwarf born in Mahakam, Bruys joined Chivay's band.[2] For several days, bard Jezkier traveled and sung by their side. During one such day, their camp had been approached by Brendan. Bruys grew warry but Chivay calmed him, introducing Brendan as an old friend.[3]Once, the group waylaid and robbed a rich hawker who tried to flee Dillingen after townfolk exposed his trade with Scoia'tael. The merchant defended his property like a lion, shouting for aid a few times until the dwarves got him with batons. Intending to fund future enterprises of each individual with the treasure, Bruys helped load the trunks on a wagon.In late summer 1267, Bruys and the rest had been escorting Kernow refugees, mothers and children, to safety. They met Geralt of Rivia and the witcher's own group for the first time on a way toward the Yaruga river from Brokilon. Chivay advised Geralt to join up with dwarves on a way eastward. When the large group became short on provisions, Bruys and Yazon Varda vanished into the dark, only to return at dawn with two full sacks, one with horse grub and the second with jerkies, cheese, huge haggis and more refreshment. Another time, he and Figgis Merluzzo went mushroom picking. Later on, Percival Schuttenbach sensed porridge with his infallible gnomish nose and stated people had to live nearby. Chivay decided he, Schuttenbach and Geralt's companions would investigate, while Bruys and Merluzzo awaited for a signal in a form of a sparrowhawk call. Bruys anxiously asked Chivay when he learned bird sounds. Chivay answered the point was if Bruys heard an unrecognizable sound, he would know it's them.After crossing Brugge, the group stopped at O. Convinced not to carry the treasure any longer, Zoltan ordered Bruys, Varda, Merluzzo and Caleb Stratton to hide it. The rest continued to Fen Carn. Much later, during an unexpected battle between the refugees-killing Nilfgaardian Army and the Temerian Army, Chivay's company reunited. They evaded death by running to the woods, but Stratton was hit by the 7th Daerlanian Cavalry Brigade. After burying Stratton and mourning his passing, the dwarves continued. They met Geralt and his company once more, in Angren, and Bruys gave each member a strong handshake. At long last, the company decided to return home to Mount Carbon.[2]Bruys fighting at Brenna.As the end of the Second Northern War had drawn near, Bruys and Merluzzo were part of officer Zoltan Chivay's unit of the Mahakam Volunteer Army. In spring 1268, most regiments sent by Elder of Mahakam Brouver Hoog suffered great losses and were withdrawn to Vizima. With time to recover, most dwarves enjoyed beer and fist-fighting at The Shaggy Bear tavern.To stop the advancing enemy, Temeria mustered its forces and prepared for the Battle of Brenna. Thousands of dogged dwarven volunteers commanded by Colonel Barclay Els stood the right-wing. Alongside the eight light cavalry companies and infamous Adieu's Free Company, unwavering in the face of Ard Feainn Division riders.When Field Marshal Menno Coehoorn tried to run from the battlefield, half-buried in mud pleading for mercy, Chivay showed him to Bruys. Mistaking the Field Marshal for a Daerlanian cavalryman due to a silver scorpion sigil, Bruys swung his weapon up. Thus, they avenged Stratton by unknowingly killing the Nilfgaardian commanding officer.Bruys always dreamed of building steam and water-powered hammerworks. Following the Peace of Cintra, he agreed to start one in Novigrad with Merluzzo and Chivay.[4] However, the mutual venture flopped.[5] Bruys returned to Vizima, moving there for good as he landed a bouncer position at The Shaggy Bear. A self-titled professional dice player, Bruys earned bonus orens gambling.In 1270, Bruys kept in touch with Zoltan Chivay who told him witcher Geralt, thought dead since pogrom in Rivia, lived. Initially refusing to believe, the dwarf welcomed Geralt with open arms when the witcher entered the tavern in Temple Quarter. When asked, Bruys praised his job as peaceful and reminded Geralt of past adventures.[1]</td></tr><tr><td>120</td><td>Ren Grouver</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>Guerrilla fighter</td><td> Scoia'tael Yaevinn</td><td>He can be found in the Vizima sewers of the Trade Quarter, if you get the Echoes of Yesterday quest and you will meet him again at the bank during the Gold Rush quest.If Geralt attacks the Scoia'tael during Gold Rush: He and the Scoia'tael robbers were killed by Geralt.</td></tr><tr><td>127</td><td>Scoia'tael quartermaster</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>Merchant Quartermaster</td><td> Scoia'tael</td><td>If Geralt has chosen the Scoia'tael path, then the quartermaster can be found on the western outskirts of Old Vizima, not far from the Gate to the Dike.

Originally a subject of Filavandrel, she became a Scoia'tael member and later joined the Vrihedd Brigade.Toruviel was part of the squad responsible for contacting Torque, a sylvan spying in Lower Posada for the elves to help them get food and learn agriculture. When their agent was endangered by the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who'd been hired to deal with the sylvan, she was among those who knocked out the witcher and the bard Dandelion and proceeded to tie them up.When the two woke up, Toruviel began to berate the bard and beat him before breaking his lute. Enraged at this, Geralt provoked Toruviel to come closer and, despite being tied up, managed to headbutt the elf, breaking her nose. With that, Toruviel made to kill the witcher but lost control and broke down crying while the other elves proceeded to bandage her nose.Later, after Dana M�adbh intervened and prevented Geralt and Dandelion's execution, the still-bandaged Toruviel gave Dandelion her own lute to replace the one she had destroyed.[1]When Scoia'tael units were formed to fight humans, Toruviel joined a commando together with Yaevinn and Cairbre aep Diared. In June 1267, while the three were on reconnaissance, she kicked Yaevinn to wake him up after Cairbre noticed a lone rider on the road from Tretogor to Aedirn. Though Toruviel tried to discourage her comrade, stating one lone human wasn't worth the effort, Yaevinn shot the commander, unaware that sparing his life would have prevented the provocation at Glevitzingen and the subsequent war.[2]Later, in early August, Toruviel and Ciaran aep Dearbh were wounded and guided by Milva to Col Serrai for healing. Not long after though, the two received news that Coinneach D� Reo's commando was recruiting new elves and went to join him despite Milva's objections.[3]Toruviel and Yaevinn took part in the Battle of Brenna as members of the Vrihedd Brigade under Isengrim Faoiltiarna. At one point in the battle Menno Coehoorn ordered Vrihedd to strike at the point where Redanians under Kobus de Ruyter stood near the Temerians.[4] Toruviel took part in the charge and was wounded in her arm by a 15 year old Redanian pikeman just before she cut his skull. She did not feel pain until the brigade breached the frontline and reached the tents and wagons.[5] There, Yaevinn broke into Rusty's tent, murdering the wounded until he saw a Nilfgaardian. Toruviel called to him to retreat after Blenheim Blenckert's reinforcements arrived.After the defeat at Brenna, a still wounded Toruviel and 7 other members of her commando fled. They spent some time in the forest, starving and pursued by White Rayla. During this time the \"\"commando\"\" met Lucienne's wagon with invalid Temerian veterans inside.

He also had his own commando in the vicinity of Vizima. He had a greater penchant for flowery words and metaphors than most elves, perhaps rivaling Dandelion alone in his prose.Yaevinn participated in the Second Nilfgaard War with Nilfgaard. During the Battle of Brenna, where he was part of the Vrihedd Brigade, he and his commando entered in the medic tent of Rusty and started to kill all the patients but they immediately stopped when they saw that the medic and his assistants were healing wounded people from both the factions, making no difference between Nilfgaardians and Nordlings.He was later seriously injured in that battle but in the end he survived to the wounds.Yaevinn appears in Chapter II of the game. He treats Geralt with hesitant respect and appeals to him to aid his faction; he reminds him that as a mutant, he would never be accepted in human society, only tolerated and could better relate to the cause of the Scoia'tael. He is eloquent and often speaks in verse, employing metaphors and literary allusions to convey his meaning.If the witcher chooses to ally himself with the Scoia'tael, Yaevinn plays an even more central role in the story. It is also Toruviel who is a member of Yaevinn's group rather than the other way around, although he does not seem to outrank her by much.On Iorveth's path during Chapter II, the Scoia'tael leader will discuss Yaevinn's legacy with Geralt in Vergen if the latter sided with the Scoia'tael or remained neutral in The Witcher.Yaevinn, same as Iorveth, does not appear in game and apart from the second one, he is not even mentioned by other characters, but he has his own gwent card as part of Scoia'tael Gwent deck.</td></tr><tr><td>151</td><td>Yaren Bolt</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td><td>He has no time for the notions of the brickmakers and views them more as trainable simpletons for his enterprise.

Regardless, he usually spent most of his time drinking heavily trying to avoid having them--something that Geralt of Rivia admitted that he understood very well.In his quest to destroy the kayran, Geralt was pointed in the direction of Cedric, who helped him find the monster. Later, Cedric told the witcher where he could find some ostmurk in order to make the Mongoose potion. As a craftsman, Cedric sold various items, including formulae for weapon oil and potions (including for Mongoose), bombs, and the design for a kayran trap.Soon afterwards, Cedric helped to protect Triss when she was attacked by Letho. However, the kingslayer managed to fatally wound Cedric, so he fled into the forest. Cedric was eventually found by Geralt, who had followed a trail of the elf's blood. As he lay dying, Cedric told Geralt about what had happened and noticed how the animal life in the forest came to bid him farewell before he passed away.</td></tr><tr><td>189</td><td>Ciaran aep Easnillen</td><td>Elf (Aen Seidhe)</td><td>Male</td><td>Soldier Rank(s) Adjutant</td><td> Iorveth Scoia'tael</td><td>Ciaran aep Easnillen was a member of Iorveth's unit who had been captured by Loredo's men, imprisoned on the Prison barge at Flotsam pier and tortured.

He defeated the commanders of many special forces of the North, including someone from the Order of the Flaming Rose, except for the Blue Stripes captain Vernon Roche. His other skills included playing the recorder.Even though he was always extremely proud of his race, Iorweth's clothes were a combination of elven and human clothing. He didn't acquire them all at once but rather stack it up with useful pieces from armors of humans he killed.[1]Iorweth and Isengrim Faoiltiarna were supposedly the only two who survived the massacre of the Vrihedd Brigade at the Ravine of the Hydra, following the peace of Cintra.Throughout the entirety of the Second Northern War, Iorweth was allied with the Nilfgaardian Empire and led a Scoia'tael commando with which he constantly caused trouble to rear of Northern Kingdoms' combined forces in the Pontar valley.One of the elves under his command was Echel Traighlethan who was captured by the Redanian Secret Service and brought to Drakenborg to be hanged.[2]When the peace of Cintra was signed between the North and Nilfgaardians on 2 April 1268, all of the Vrihedd Brigade officers and Scoia'tael leaders were rounded up to be executed in line with what was agreed at negotiations.[3]Iorweth somehow managed to escape and survive long enough to assemble a new commando from elves dissatisfied with the outcome of the war. One by one, Iorweth and his guerilla fighters defeated most of the Northern special forces with the major exception being the Blue Stripes of Temeria.Sometime around November 1270, Iorweth was approached by a mysterious individual claiming to be a friend of nonhumans with an offer: the man wanted to kill kings for his own inscrutable reasons and would like Iorweth's help in the form of the elf's knowledge of secret trails and weapon stashes. To back his claim, this man showed Iorweth the head of Demavend, King of Aedirn, Lord of Dol Blathanna and Sovereign of the Pontar Valley.Four months later, Geralt, Triss, and Vernon Roche met Iorweth. Roche quickly showed that he knew the elf and they were quite hostile to each other, hinting at less-than-pleasant past experiences. Shortly afterward, it became clear that Iorweth managed to rebuild the commandos he lost during the war, as elves attacked Geralt and company on his orders.He was pushed by circumstances to the very edge of society, painfully aware that the Scoia'tael have been used in the war with Nilfgaard and have been ruthlessly sacrificed during peace negotiations. He was also determined not to let that happen again. He enjoyed a fierce loyalty from his men. None of them would ever betray Iorweth and this speaks volumes in his favor. Indeed, he was a skilled commander and as cunning as a fox.Considered a mass murderer and terrorist, even by Saskia, he had nonetheless come to understand that the ways of the Scoia'tael are doomed to fail, hence the reason he did not join Yaevinn and instead chose to fight side by side with humans and dwarves led by Saskia to secure the foundation of an independent state in Upper Aedirn, with a capital in Vergen. A state with egalitarian laws between elves, humans and dwarves.No matter the outcome of the conflict, Iorweth had already left Aedirn by the spring of 1272. He took his Scoia'tael with him, departing for unknown reasons. Unfortunately, his departure significantly reduced Vergen's military capabilities.[4] Though it's not confirmed where he went to, he was alive and safe there at least the remainder of the year.[5]Chapter I:Chapter II:Chapter III:Iorveth's Gwent card artworkIn the final game, Iorveth and Isengrim are mentioned by their fellow Scoia'tael warriors, in a camp outside of Novigrad.

He also has a Gwent hero card.Marcin Momot later confirmed that Iorveth is alive and well but that he would not appear in the game.[5][8] On 4 July 2016 short comic strip named Where is Iorveth? was released.Iorveth was involved in the large Nilfgaardian centric subplot which centered around an outbreak of the Catriona plague. This quest line had its own set of writers and designers, and remnants of the quest line exist in the form of: An Eye for an Eye, Blood Ties, and Contract: Patrol Gone Missing.[9] This quest line was also the original implementation of the Hearts of Stone expansion, before it was cut and completely redone for the expansion pack.[10]Iorveth would have appeared in Velen searching for a cure for the Catriona plague which was ravaging Velen and most of the southern part of the Continent, including Mahakam. Geralt would have to form a sensitive alliance between Iorveth, Roche, Ves and Thaler in order to obtain this cure from a rogue Nilfgaardian scientist called Martin aka Hector Krafft Ebbing. This questline was also meant to explore the Nilfgaardian's impact on the area, showing that they were not always the most enlightened group of people, and would go to extreme lengths in the name of law and order.[11]A playable build of this quest line existed, and was cut very late into production due to allegedly not fitting in well with the rest of the game, and requiring too many resources to complete.[12]A model was worked on internally, and a render of his character was set to be included in the Prima Guide. The original plan would have involved Geralt meeting him in Novigrad, along with other Scoia'tael.He would have had a role in at least 6 quests: Pyres of Novigrad, Get Junior, sq305-Scoia'tael (which later became Woodland Beast), a cut side-quest called sq309-Investigation, The Battle of Kaer Morhen and Final Preparations.Not much is known about SQ309-Investigation, but it would have involved a scene with Iorveth hiding in a basement of a house in the non-human district. He would have been playing his flute, using the same song, Stella Splendens, from The Witcher 2. This quest would have also featured an Elven Portal, although it's not specified what it would have been used for.SQ305-Scoia'tael would have involved other Scoia'tael commanders, such as Isengrim Faoiltiarna, Vernossiel, Gronostaj and Yrlissa. This quest was significantly reworked, and made it into the game as Woodland Beast. Vernossiel made the cut, but none of the other characters did. This quest was also mentioned in the preliminary Prima Guide.At the beginning of Pyres of Novigrad, he would have helped Geralt find Triss, and they would have gone to her house together. This would have made a lot of sense depending on your choices in The Witcher 2, as Triss can save his life in the epilogue. He would also have had connections to the criminal underground, knowing both The King of Beggars and Cleaver. There are mentions of other dialogue scenes, between Roche, Iorveth and Geralt, at the docks in Novigrad. A bug report from an Alpha build states that the writers needed to fully explain the relationship dynamic between them, and why they wanted to kill each other, because of events in the past.He would have taken part in the Battle of Kaer Morhen. The dialogue scenes between Roche, Letho and Ves were originally meant to be between Roche, Letho and Iorveth. File names for these cutscenes, in the retail product, reference this original plan:\"\"quests/part_2/quest_files/q403_battle/scenes/q403_10_letho_vs_roche_iorweth.w2scene\"\"\"\"quests/part_2/quest_files/q403_battle/scenes/q403_11_roche_iorweth.w2scene\"\"\"\"quests/part_2/quest_files/q403_battle/scenes/q403_34a_roche_iorweth_after_battle.w2scene\"\".Character descriptions for both Iorveth and Isengrim Faoiltiarna were also going to appear in the preliminary Prima guide.[13]Comments about Iorveth from the CDPR developers Jan Bartkowicz (Story Writer)</td></tr><tr><td>237</td><td>Isidor Kay</td><td>Dwarf</td><td>Male</td><td>Merchant Craftsman</td><td>null</td><td>\"Isidor Kay (spelled \"\"Isidor Quay\"\" in the journal heading) is a secondary character in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings.

It is known however, that he became a leader of his dwarven company which included Lucas Corto, Paulie Dahlberg, Regan Dahlberg, Xavier Moran, and Yannick Brass. This group traveled the Continent and hunted large and dangerous game.During that time, Yarpen and his company had apparently slain a dragon called Ocvist. Soon afterwards they traveled to Caingorn, where another dragon had been sighted and a hunt called. When they arrived in the kingdom, they joined the hunting party.Yarpen's group was just one of many parties participating in the hunt. Officially, the hunt was under the command of King Niedamir, but he did not really command anything. Other individuals joining the hunt were Knight Eyck of Denesle, Boholt and his Crinfrid Reavers, sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, witcher Geralt of Rivia, bard Dandelion, sorcerer Dorregaray, and last but not least, Knight Borch Three Jackdaws with his company of two Zerrikanian women (T�a and V�a). The target of the hunt was a large, female Green dragon that made a nest in the area. Shortly before the hunt commenced, the dragon was poisoned by some locals, and though seriously wounded, she survived.Thus the hunt begun. Very soon, Yarpen made a deal with Boholt about the dragon, the killing and mainly the share of the dragon's treasure. During the hunt, they encountered many perils such as a rock slide that almost killed the sorceress and the witcher but the two were saved by Eyck. They eventually reached their goal and stood face to face with the wounded dragon, but before they could attack another dragon appeared, this time a Golden dragon. Villentretenmerth, the dragon, used his telepathy and told the party he would fight them in a fair duel. Eyck of Denesle did not hesitate and swiftly attackeded but the dragon quickly defeated his foe and sent him, along with his horse, flying across the valley.After this, the King Niedamir decided to leave. However, the Reavers and Yarpen's group agreed they would still finish the hunt and kill the golden dragon. The hunting party argued, for Geralt, Dandelion, and Dorregaray did not want to kill such a beast and were against it. Boholt and Yarpen, along with their men, quickly defeated and bound all those who opposed them. The sorceress Yennefer, who at first appeared to side with the hunters, tried to use some spells against the hunters but was knocked off by Yarpen and tied up as well. With all the opposition tied up, Yarpen's and Boholt's men attacked the dragon.Though the golden dragon defeated them as well, the local militia arrived during the fight and attacked. The combined forces of all the men proved too much for the dragon and he began to lose. Fortunately, Yennefer, Geralt, Dandelion, and Dorregaray managed to free themselves and tried to defend the golden dragon. Likewise, T�a and V�a appeared and started to kill one man after another. Eventually, the defenders repelled the attackers and Villentretenmerth emerged victorious. He however forbade any more killing and thus the Reavers and Yarpen's group survived.

However, when a fellow swordsmith, Ernst van Hoorn, started their own business, van Hoorn realized they lacked real skill to compete with the others in the area and so began to find other ways to monopolize on the swordsmithing trade, pushing anyone out of business or making false accusations, like accusing Hattori of working with havekars.Hattori tried to fight back and took the matter to town hall, but with van Hoorn backed by a local gang leader, Cleaver, Hattori's appeal was denied.

For additional information, I also determine the **term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)**. This basically lowers the importance of words that appear in every entry. For example, given that all the characters are part of the Witcher universe, the word witcher will likely appear quite frequently. This does not mean, however, that this is very useful word to predict with as it can be applied to all entries. The TF-IDF score account for this fact. Finally, the indexer step translates the values for race to numbers. This is because predictions can only be performed on numbers. All these steps together transform the data in something that we can use to make the prediction. \n\nNote that in the code below I manually set a number of common stop words to be removed."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["words_to_remove_list = [\"i\", \"me\", \"my\", \"myself\", \"we\", \"our\", \"ours\", \"ourselves\", \"you\", \"your\", \"yours\", \"yourself\", \"yourselves\", \"he\", \"him\", \"his\", \"himself\", \"she\", \"her\", \"hers\", \"herself\", \"it\", \"its\", \"itself\", \"they\", \"them\", \"their\", \"theirs\", \"themselves\", \"what\", \"which\", \"who\", \"whom\", \"this\", \"that\", \"these\", \"those\", \"am\", \"is\", \"are\", \"was\", \"were\", \"be\", \"been\", \"being\", \"have\", \"has\", \"had\", \"having\", \"do\", \"does\", \"did\", \"doing\", \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"and\", \"but\", \"if\", \"or\", \"because\", \"as\", \"until\", \"while\", \"of\", \"at\", \"by\", \"for\", \"with\", \"about\", \"against\", \"between\", \"into\", \"through\", \"during\", \"before\", \"after\", \"above\", \"below\", \"to\", \"from\", \"up\", \"down\", \"in\", \"out\", \"on\", \"off\", \"over\", \"under\", \"again\", \"further\", \"then\", \"once\", \"here\", \"there\", \"when\", \"where\", \"why\", \"how\", \"all\", \"any\", \"both\", \"each\", \"few\", \"more\", \"most\", \"other\", \"some\", \"such\", \"no\", \"nor\", \"not\", \"only\", \"own\", \"same\", \"so\", \"than\", \"too\", \"very\", \"s\", \"t\", \"can\", \"will\", \"just\", \"don\", \"should\", \"now\"]"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":["document_assembler = DocumentAssembler() \\\n    .setInputCol(\"text\") \\\n    .setOutputCol(\"document\")\n    \nsentence_detector = SentenceDetector() \\\n    .setInputCols([\"document\"]) \\\n    .setOutputCol(\"sentence\") \\\n    .setUseAbbreviations(True)\n    \ntokenizer = Tokenizer() \\\n  .setInputCols([\"sentence\"]) \\\n  .setOutputCol(\"token\")\n\nstop_words_cleaner = StopWordsCleaner() \\\n        .setInputCols([\"token\"]) \\\n        .setOutputCol(\"cleanTokens\") \\\n        .setCaseSensitive(False) \\\n        .setStopWords(words_to_remove_list)\n    \nnormalizer = Normalizer() \\\n    .setInputCols([\"cleanTokens\"]) \\\n    .setOutputCol(\"normalized\")\n\nlemmatizer = LemmatizerModel.pretrained(name='lemma', lang='nl') \\\n     .setInputCols(['normalized']) \\\n     .setOutputCol('lemma')\n\nfinisher = Finisher() \\\n    .setInputCols([\"lemma\"]) \\\n    .setOutputCols([\"ntokens\"]) \\\n    .setOutputAsArray(True) \\\n    .setCleanAnnotations(False) \ncountvectorizer = CountVectorizer(inputCol=\"ntokens\", outputCol=\"features\", minDF = 3.0)\n\nidf = IDF(inputCol=\"features\", outputCol=\"features_updated\")\n\nindexer = StringIndexer(inputCol=\"race\", outputCol=\"raceIndex\")\n\nnlp_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[document_assembler, sentence_detector, tokenizer, stop_words_cleaner, normalizer, lemmatizer, finisher, countvectorizer, idf, indexer])"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">lemma download started this may take some time.\nApproximate size to download 285.9 KB\n\r[ | ]\r[OK!]\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Before we move to predict anything, I first divide the data in a training and test subset.

Of course, this model can be further improved and more data should be added in order to obtain better predictions. However, what I have shown here are some of the basic steps and capabilities Databricks offers in terms of NLP and Machine Learning.\n\nTo summarize, Azure Databricks offers an easy to use data analytics platform in the cloud. It is able to ingest data from multiple sources, such as a data lake, and apply machine learning on this data. The possibilies in this regard are endless, and in this example I gave a quick demonstration of how to use unstructured text data and use it to determine a fanatasy characters' race using NLP. \n\nIf you are curious about other possibilies Databricks could offer you or you are intrigued by this article please let me know. I am always eager to discuss these topics with interested readers. Also, if you have opportunities or resources for me to expand my knowledge regarding this topic, do not hestitate to contact me! I am also always up for a round of Gwent ;)"],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"The Witcher on Azure","notebookId":1507006614546584},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
